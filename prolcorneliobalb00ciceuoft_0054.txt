50 PRO BALBO. [g 5-

used in verse before Vergil, nor in prose before Tacitus, The gen. occurs
in Plaut. Trin. 5, 2, 29 (as quoted by Nonius, and approved by Ritschl
and Brix—though the existing MSS have the ablative). It is not allowed
in Liv. 4, 37, 1, though in a letter of this very Balbus preserved in Cic.
Att. 8, 15 A, 1 Boot still keeps cogitationem dignissimam tuae virtutis.

quod...constet etc. .· for the reasoning see Introd. p. 15. Constet is in
the subjunctive by attraction to the mood of concedant; cf. Tusc. 5,

2ο hesterno die: so 2, 1. 123 this phrase seems more used in formal,
while here or heri is more used in colloquial passages, by Cic: at least.
Ilodierno die for hodie is less common. ,

21 ipse: Pompeius, not Balbus. Ipse often thus means “the great
man”‚ i.e. the chief personage of a number in question ς cf. Nat. Deor.

nullius in d..· for the position ot in cf. n. on Arch. 1, 1. 1. The
phrase in crimen vocare is common and is followed sometimes by an acc.
of a person, sometimes by an acc. of the fault, as avaritiam (Verr. 3,
217); sometimes the fault is in the abl. with de, as below, 65, p. 46,
1. 1. For the gen. here cf. Scaur. 3 proditionis est in crimen vocatus.

22 furatus: this application to immaterial things is rather rare3 cf.
Prop. 5, 2, 31 speciem furabor Iacchi. By stealing the citizenship is
meant representing oneself as citizen without being so in reality.

23 genus ementitus: “to have falsely represented his family’'‚ zze. to
have falsely claimed a descent which would have entitled him to the
citizenship. With the constr. cf. ψεύδεσθαί τι, to make a false represen-
tation about a thing, as in Thuc. 6, 1 7 ; also Demosth. Eubul. 1314 τοῖς
ὤν μέν εἰσιν ἀποκρυπτομένοις, ὧν δέ οὐκ εἰσὶ προσποιουμένοις.

was a severe war'’; cf. n. on Arch. 3, l. 10.

cum Q. Metello, cum C. Memmio: note the omission of et before the
second cum, which gives force and vividness to the statement 3 also the
fact that all the clauses from fatetur to the end os the senteri'ce are
