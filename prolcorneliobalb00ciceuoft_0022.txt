ἕδη-26. Cicero now proceeds to shew the unreasonable·
ness of the restriction contended for by the prosecutor, which
would deprive Rome of the aid of individuals from the allied
states, and prevent the individuals themselves from gaining the
Roman citizenship, though it was open to inferior classes of
Roman subjects‚ even down to the slave population. “If the
Gaditanes by a formal decree forbade their citizens to serve
Rome at their own private risk‚ the Roman government would
resent it. What the prosecutor contends for is practically the
same thing, since he would place it in the power of the Gadi-
tanes to stand between those who volunteer for the Roman
service, and their proper reward.''

ἐξ 27-31. These sections expound the public policy of
Rome with regard to change of country. The statements of
Cicero on this subject are important. He maintains that
Rome always allowed to her own citizens the most absolute
freedom to migrate and acquire citizenship in another state,
and always assumed the unlimited right of foreigners to acquire
the Roman franchise if she-chose to bestow it. The only
difference between Roman and foreign practice in this matter
was that no one could be a citizen of Rome and of other cities
at the same time, while foreigners who were not Roman citizens
could be on the burgess-rolls of any number of cities.

ἐξ 32—37. Cicero now rebuts some other arguments of his
opponent. Because some treaties contained a stipulation for-
bidding Rome to receive as citizens members of ‘the contracting
nations, the prosecutor argued that such a restriction must be
assumed to apply to the Gaditane treaty, though not therein
expressed. Cicero points out that such restrictions, being rare
exceptions‚ only prove the rule that Rome is free to confer the
franchise on whom she pleases. He even contends that any
such treaty stipulation would be overridden by the lex Gellia
Cornelia. He here treads on rather dangerous ground, for his
argument really involves the assumption that the resolutions of
the comitia ought to override all treaty obligations He next
turns to another of the prosecutor's arguments. The lex Gellia
Cornelia contained a formal clause which provided that none of
its enactments should be valid as against engagements in their
