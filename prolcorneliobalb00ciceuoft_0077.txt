ret'ectione: i. e. by actual enrolment as citizen in another city, which
is not implied in axsdium.
ut iam: probably ut ought to be struck out. The words imply ‘⁴ I

now come to deal with the question of treaty’'‚ whereas the context
evidently requires ‘⁸ Ι shall come to the treaty by and by”.

14 via.- so 54, 1. 18; iter: cf. aditus ad c. in 54, l. 12, ascensus adc. in
40, 1. 11. Nagelsbach, Stilistik ἓ 167, 3, well calls attention to the
elaborate chiasmus (inversion of the order of words in corresponding
groups) which is shewn by the difference of type thus: cum cx omni-
bus civitatibus via sit in nostram cumque nostris civibus pateat ad
feteras iter civita tes. N otice cum—tum—vero ; the vero lays greater
¹{ress on the second clause than would be assigned to it by cum—tum

one.

16 sponsione pactione foedere: n. on ι 5, p. 25, l. 33. Sponsz'o here is
very slightly different from pactio. Both imply agreements entered into
with the enemy by a Roman commander without special authorisation
from the government; the difference lies only in the fhrm of the agree-
ment, which in the case of sponsio (whether used in private or public
affairs) was concluded by the solemn question which each of the parties
put to‘ the other “spondesne'’, and the solemn answer which each
gave “spondeo''. The Romans several times refused to ratify spon-
siones entered into by commanders (as at the Caudine F orks and
Numantia) who were in that case handed over to the enemy (dediti).

and commonly illud, id, quid.
