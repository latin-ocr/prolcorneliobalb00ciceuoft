Menandro: his case is quoted in the Digest 49, 15, 15, 3, as from ’
Q. Mucius Scaevola. He had no doubt been originally captured in war
by the Romans, and seared that if he did not take precautions, it might be
contended at some future time that the principle of postliminium applied to
him. Thus he would have regained his original franchise and ipso fizcto
would have lost the Roman citizenship. As a rule the interpretes were
hired in the provinces, being almost the only officers whom a provincial
governor did not take with him from Rome.

legati nostri: probably a senatorial commission (usually of ten mem·
bers) of the kind generally sent out to arrange for the permanent settle-
ment of a conquered province. Such a commission was sent out to
aid L. Paulus in settling Macedonia (167 B.C., see Liv. 45, 17), another
to help Mummius to put in order the affairs of Greeee (146 B.C., see Att.

13, 6, 4 and 13, 30, 3 and 13, 32, 3). Menander may have served
either of these commissions.

superiore memoria: “in the history of former times ”3 cf. recens me-

{norz'a (²33 the history of recent times''), nostra memoria (“ contemporary
ns ory .

incolumes: cf. Arch. 9, l. 21.

leis rebus :zleac republica as in Arch. 22, l. αι and Acad. 2, 58 Deli,

Gaditanum .· a remarkable constr. (sor Gaditano), well discussed by
Madvig, Opusc. 2, 29, who declares that only two similar passages (of
certain reading) are to be found in authors of repnte, viz. Ter. Haut. 2,
4, 8 (expedit bonas esse vobis), Quintil. 7, 1, 193 F orcellini however qu.
also Quint. 4, 4, 6, Ov. Her. 14, 64. Mr Roby rightly explains the sen-
tence (vol. 2, pref. p. 2 5), “ the being a Gaditan is a thing permitted to a
Roman citizen'’, Gaditanum being ‘⁶ not a predicate of civi, but of the
unexpressed subject which lies in the abstract use of the infinitive”. The
constr. will become still clearer if we write in the above translation ‘⁸ for
one to be” or “that one should be” instead of “the being”. Esse
Gaditanum is in fact subject to licet, which here happens to have a dat..
dependent on it. When the dat. dependent on licet is not expressed,
the accus. with inf. is not only a possible, but the necessary constr.
In Att. 10, 8 Cic. writes nam medios esse iam non licebit ; if nohis had
been added the constr. would have been identical with the one in the
text. Cf. also Fam. 7, 1, 5 neque nos lepore tuo neque te meo frui
liceret, Verg. Aen. ιο, 2 36 dedit (eis not expressed) esse deas, where
deas is subject of esse, while esse deas is object of dedit. Similar to the
constr. of licet here is that of ἔξεστι in eXX. like Thuc. 4, 20 ἔξεστιν
ὑμῖν φίλους γενέσθαι. ”

exsilio: exile, as Cic. states in Caec. roo, was never assigned by law
as a punishment for any offence; it was not supplicium but perfugium
