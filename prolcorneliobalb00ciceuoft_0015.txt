real object of attack. The law-courts at Rome were freely used
for the purpose of annoying‚ directly or indirectly, political
enemies1. In this case there were no doubt powerful political
personages behind the nominal prosecutor.

We are not even in possession of this person's name. He
was a Gaditane‚ who had somehow attained the Roman fran—
chise3 it has been conjectured that he received it from Pompeius
as Balbus did, but in that case Cicero would surely have men-
tioned the circumstance. Owing to a conviction in a criminal
trial, he had suffered deprivation of civil rights². One method
of rehabilitation was by a successful prosecufion, when the
prosecutor regained the privileges he had lost3. This was no
doubt the bait that lured the prosecutor, and made him a ready
tool in the hands of the enemies of Balbus. .

In order to estimate the strength of Balbus' case, it. is neces-
sary to consider the lex Gellia Cornelia, under which Pompeius
acted in enfranchising Balbus& The law was carried in 72 B.C. by
the consuls L. Gellius Publicola and Cn. Cornelius Lentulus Clo-
dianus, in accordance with a decree of the Senate. It empowered
Pompeius, acting under the advice of his consilium5, to confer
the Roman civitas on individuals (singillatim), not on communi-
ties⁶. It must be noticed that during the whole of the Republi-
can period, the power of extending the Roman burgess body lay
ultimately with the burgesses themselves, in comitia assembled⁷.
In the last three centuries of the Republic, at least, the princi-
ple stood firm that this privilege belonged not to the comitia
centuriata but to the comitia tributa, because membership of a
tribe and citizenship were convertible terms. A plebiscitum
