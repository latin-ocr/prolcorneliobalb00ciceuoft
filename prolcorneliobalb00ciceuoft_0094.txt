sesses to quote its exact clauses, so that his story is most likely, at
bottom, the same with that of Cicero. The story has in recent times
been treated with great incredulity. The latest historian of Rome
(Ihne) has not even had the patience to examine it sair1y3 his remarks
(vol.'1. p. 70) are inaccurate and most unjust to Dionysius. 1 believe
myself that a tablet of the kind was actually seen by Cicero, but that it
contained not c{he original foedus of 493, but a copy made in 358 when
it was renewe .

nuper...memim'mus .· nuper points to a time not long past3 memini-
mus is not the same as ego memini, for the existence of the columna was
a fact which must have been within the knowledge of many of Cic-’s

llijeiarers. It may quite possibly have been removed to the temple of
iana. ,

6 L. Cossinius .· probably a man mentioned by Plutarch, Crass. 9, who
fell while serving as legatus to the praetor P. Vatinius, in command
against Spartacus, 73 B.c.

7 Tiburs: the town of Tibur, like Praeneste, remained in the position
of a civitas fhederata down to the time of the Lex Iulia (9ο B.C.).

12 anne: note the succession an—anne—an—an. No reason can be
assigned for the variation. Though anne is comparatively rare, it occurs
both in direct and in indirect questions in authors of all epochs, and does
not appreciably differ from an> in meaning.

13 de nobis spolia: an invidious expression is chosen, as the role of
accusator was unpopular at Rome.

17 lege Servilia : probably passed about 104 B, c.; fragments of a law
generally identified with it are still preserved. It related to the offence

principes⁸ viri eta: i. e. the Senate ; see below, n. on l. 22.

18 Latinis, id est fhederatis: observe that id est is often, as here, intro·
ductory not to a mere explanation, but to an emphatic extension of the
original statement; so 24, 1. 19 libertate, idest civitate.

Latins, yet no attempt was made to deprive them of the privilege which
the lex Servilia gave them.

the sense “ to censure a privilege '’ is strange ; possibly, however, repre·
