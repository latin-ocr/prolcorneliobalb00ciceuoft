16 JNTRODUCJJON,

ξ 17. The impossibility of saying anything new aster the
speeches of Crassus and Pompeius is again insisted upon.
ἐξ 18, 19. The prosecution is attributed to envy at the brilliant
social success of Balbus, which envy the jury assuredly will not
share.

The way is now prepared for the savourable rece-ption by the¹
jury of the legal arguments.

ἕξ 19—22. Rebutment of the prosecutor's argument, that
populi foederati were excepted from the operation of the lex
Gellia Cornelia unless they had formally adopted it them-
selves.

There is no doubt that Cicero has unfairly represented the
prosecutor's contention. He had pointed to the undoubted fact,
’ which Cicero himself admits ¹, that whenever communz'ties by
act of the comitia had been enfranchised, the enfranchise-
ment had not taken effect until the communities themselves had
adopted the act. The fault in his argument, which Cicero
does not state so clearly as he might, was that he applied to the
enfranchisement of individuals a principle only applicable to the
enfranchisement of whole communities. When the status osa
whole community was to be changed, its assent was necessary,
but to suppose that no single individual from the community
could change his status to that of a Roman citizen without its
assent, was absurd.

The way Cicero puts it is this, that the adoption of
Roman laws by allied states is a boon allowed them by the
Roman people, but a boon which could not be permitted to
restrict in any way the power of the government to pay by the
citizenship for any special services conferred on it by individual
members of the allied states.

In the very important passage now under consideration the
different classes of Roman subjects are frequently mentioned-
socii, liberi populi, foederati, Latini, stipendiarii. It is neces-
sary to say a few words about these terms.

The subject populations of the Roman empire under the
Republic may be roughly divided into two classes (a) those
