profic-ultan, pro Ioco: “considering his opportunities and the posi-
tion he was in''—as friend of Caesar, the quondam enemy of Cic. ·

25 ¹¹¹8mm αὐτώ quos nullos habet .- “ not by his own enemies, of whom he
none .

ς σο.

3ο erat...gemmm...temperemus .· here erat is used like the Platonic ἥν-
“ was, as Pompeius stated''. This use is common in Cic.'s philosophi.
cal writings3 e-g. Acad. 1, 23. If imperfect tenses had followed, the
statement would have been merely looked at as part of Pompeius’
speeeh3 the present tenses lay stress on the fact that the principle laid
down is permanent, and in force at the moment of speaking.

3¹ implicantur: usually followed in Cic. by the ablative without in;
cs. Pis. 70 implicatus fhmz‘liaritate. The statement found in some
lexim that Cic. uses the dative construction is a mistake. In Brut. 174
oratoribus and inDe Div. 1, 79 naturis are ablatives.

32 amans-.- a dative3 so Hor. Od. 3, 24, 18 pn'zig’mk m’ulzer temperat
innocens and Verr. 2, ¹7 cuiquam etc„ ib. 1, ¹54 sociis, for which Liv.
6. 17, 8 has a sactis, a constr. not sound in Cic„ though osten attributed
to him3 it occurs in Caes. B. G. ι, 7, 5, and the poets. It is said that
Cic-does not use the Lat. of the personal pronoun aster temperare, though
it is found in prose of his time. as Caes. B. G. 1, 33, 4, (Cornificius)
Ad Her. 4, 25, Plancus in Cic. Fam. 10, 7, ’κ’

ι cum...v2derent .· observe (a) the elliptic nature of the expression, which
is common with cum praesertim in Latin‚· as with ἄλλως τε καὶ in Greek,
the sense fully expressed being ut aequum est multis de causis et praeser-
tim cum ς (b) the tense of viderent, the clause being looked on (contrary
to English idiom) as part of the unfulfilled condition introduced by si ;
(c) the separation of cum from praesertim by me, which is very unusual;
so however Pis, 68 cum esset p„ Phil. 1, 27 cum tanta p. gladiorum sit
impunitas, Verr. 3, 68 cum ille magno p. emisset.

6 tionrauneri: a duty of legal, as opposed to officio, a* duty of moral obliga-

7 sapiens: Cic„ more sparingly than later writers, but still frequently,
applies to inanimate things adjectives which properly denote some acti·
vity osa person3 so sapiens sententia in De Or. 1, 31 and 3, 13, temperatio
Ᾰὲιῖξὶεξί 3, 17, excusatio in Att. 8, 12, 2. Other exx. in N‘agelsbach

8 ’ voluimus: i.e. 1, Cicero; alii=others of my party. The accusative

of aneut. pron. after velle is admissible3 but no other; cf. 38, l. 10 5 52,
l. 32 hoc contendere.
