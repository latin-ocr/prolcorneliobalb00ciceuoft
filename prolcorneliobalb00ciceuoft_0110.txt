placed it after Gaditano3 thus the clause nearly resembles l. 28 νὴ
in foederibus exceptum est ne. [Ι now see that Halm suggests in.

ἓ 33, 1. 7 sacrosanctum: Madvig ejects and ΒΚ bracket. Ι fail to
see what is gained. Cic. admits that sacrosancta foedera were nominally
excepted in the law. Would he then say “what is there in the law
which makes any exception ?’' If the context be carefully read the
general meaning is seen to be “ how do you (the prosecutor) make out
that the law contains any excepting clause applicable to tlte Gaditane
treaty?'' Either then we must suppose that Cic. has in this sentence
only partially expressed his meaning, leaving it in part to his hearers to
supply a limitation such as ita ut ad fhedus Gaditanum pertineret [there
is a similar ellipse below in nec quicquam illis verbis...exceptum videretur
where quod ad foedus Gaditanum pertineret must be supplied] or the
passage requires a more trenchant correction than that of Madvig. In
the place of aliquid we might read liquido ut, supplying foedus Gadi-
tanum from 32, p. 33, 1. 2 as subject to videretur. It is an advantage
to get rid of aliquid, for which Cic. would more naturally have written
quicquam ; liquido too is a favourite Ciceronian word. The meaning is
“ what words are there in the law which explicitly except the Gaditane
treaty as being sacrosanctum ?” Before leaving this difficult passage, Ι
will call attention to 32, p. 33, 1. 2 exceptum est foedus si quid (where C
and edd. have wrongly quidem, which Ι have corrected) etc. which does
not m ean ‘⁶ any treaty is excepted isit is sacrosanctum, ” but ‘ ‘ the Gaditane
treaty is excepted under the clause (supply illis verbis as below, 1.” 18) si
quid etc.’' The sentence is slightly elliptic, as is the case very often when
legal forms are quoted.--l. 9 sanxit: so Madv. for C sanxisset3 a com-
mon change.-l. 10 ipso poenae aut.- C have ipso aut, but after legit
have aut poenae. I have put poenae after ipso, ejecting aut; for the
‘sense see n. I have been unable to extract satisfactory sense from any
of the numerous emendations heretosore proposed; 1 will therefore not
discuss them. One difficulty remains. In 1. 13 the capitis consecratio
and the obtestatzb legas are contrasted, while in l. 10 they are put on the
same footing. Now before capitis in 1. 13 the MSS have a; is this a
remnant of an and ought we to read utrum poena an capitis consecratione
et...?—l. 16 latum esset.- after this C have neque legem neque poenam
gratam esse, ejected by edd„ but probably not wholly spurious, though
it is difficult to alter the words so as to fit into the text.—-l. 18 est, esse:
C esset, esse. Probably esse ought to be struck out, as a duplicatio of the
mistaken esset. See above, 1. 7 and 38, l. 17.

Mss.—l. ἰι ille: Halm suggests illis locus, which is far from being an
im rovement.
