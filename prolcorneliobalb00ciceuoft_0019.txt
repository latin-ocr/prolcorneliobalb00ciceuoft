[NTROD UCTJON. 15

Sulla, Flaccus and Sestius, before the case of Balbus, and Milo

afterwards, Cicero spoke aster the other advocates.
We know the name neither of the prosecutor nor of the judge
who tried the case. It undoubtedly ended in an acquittal of

Balbus.

d. Anat-'yses os tlte speech and comments on the arguments
it contains.

§5 1-16. Introduction, almost entirely devoted to praise

’ of Pompeius. In ἐξ 1-4 Cicero expresses his inability to rival

the speeches of his predecessors, especially that of Pompeius,
which had exhausted the subject. At ξς begins a theme
which is harped upon repeatedly. Anyllzz‘ng which Pom-
peius llas done must needs be lawsul or else he would v not have
done it. In ἐξ 6, 7 Cicero paints glowingly the services of
Balbus, to shew that he deserved the citizenship, and to excite
'sympathy with him when he has to bear the brunt of an attack
which really ought to be directed against Pompeius. In ἐξ 9, 10
the career of Pompeius is sketched. It is absurd to suppose that
a man of such achievements would do anything illegal. ἕξ 11, 12.
“We no more ought to examine into the legality of Pompeius’
actions than did our fathers into the accuracy of Metellus'
accounts, or the Athenians into the trustworthiness of Xeno-
crates' words. §13. It is monstrous to say that Pompeius
would violate a treaty knowingly. ξ 14. WelI, says the prose-
cutor, he did it ignorantly. But ignorance, when a man is in
such a position, is even a more serious fault, than conscious
guilt. ξ 15. It happens that Pompeius is especially skilled in
the treaty relations of Rome with foreign states; he must have
learned thoroughly by experience abroad what we learn imper-
fectly from books at home. ξ 16. Were Pompeius one of the
old heroes of Rome, and were he now accused in our presence
of breaking treaty obligations, we should scout the charge as
’ ridiculous.''

Up to this point there is a great deal of declamation‚ and
very little argument. All that has been done is to excite
sympathy for Balbus, and to establish strongly the antecedent
improbability os illegal action on the part of Pompeius. q
