1 3 quod maxime pelendnm est: “ a request which it is most important to

make, I do not make’'; Cic. proceeds however to make it indirectly and
all the more effectually.

18 poeniendam .- see Appendix.
illud peto.- for omission of sed or tamen cf. n. on 6, p. 23, 1. 5.

‘zo adiumento, impedimento.- predicative datives; many exx. in Roby,
Gram. 2, p. xxxvn, XLVI. So magno usui in 24, 1. 15.

22 ea lege: Introd. p. 11.

2 3 ex senatus sententia .· the senatus consultum was a usual, though not a
necessary preliminary for all laws 3 the actual consuls, however, were
always expected to be in auctoritate senatus, ile. obedient to the expressed

wish of the Senate‚ and did not proceed to legislation without securing
the Senate's approval.

²4 ita esse sanctum : see Appendix.
25 consili: 11, 1. 29.

singillatim: this form has more MSS authority here than singulatim ;
both seem to have been in use (Neue 2, 668, ed. 2).

26 ,Pompeius dicit: the circumstances in Arch. 8 are similar; cs. p. 24,
1. 2 Lucullus...d2·cz·t.

27 tabulae: probably a formal and regularly attested document drawn
up by Pompeius and deposited among the public records.

²9 fundus: for the legal application of the word to the present case see
Introd. p. 15. The word is probably not connected with fundus, a
sarm (with which πυθμὴν, Germ. boden, Eng. bottom are related ; see
Curtius, Greek Etym.‚ Eng. Tr. 1, 326), but is derived from an original
root bhandk, meaning to tie (Eng. band, hond, bind), from a weakened
form of which (bhidlz) without the nasal, come πείθω, πίστις, fides,
foedus (Curtius 1, 3² 5). Fundus fieri is therefore literally “to become
bound''‚ so to accept an obligation 3 hence it is equivalent to auctor fieri
in Plaut. Trin. 5, 1, 6 ut fundus pater sit potior, tle. a better security, or
guarantor sor a debt. Paulus (ex Festo) p. 89, 1 indeed explains the
word by auctor, “fundus quoque dicitur populus esse rei quam alienat, hoc
est auctor''‚ i.e. “ the nation is the guarantor of the title to any property
sold on national account⁷'. The word scarce occurs out of this speech

{acepit in the two passages quoted and Gellius 16, 13, 6, who uses it as
ic. oes.

venire in civilatem .· “become a citizen ''; so 29, l. 12 ς 44, l. 20 and
venire in senatum in Att. 10, 11, 4, Flace. 42.

ξ 20.

o praeclarum: “here is a fine lawyer‘’; the interjection has quite
a different soree from that in 13, 1. 7, where, be it observed, it is fol-
lowed by the nominative, not the accusative case.
