3¹ donasset: like esset above, in the subj. because the prosecutor’s view
of the matter is indicated.

3² L. Antistius.- the only man of the name to whom this can possibly
refer was tribune in 58 Β. C., and prosecuted Caesar (Suet. Iul. 23),
but most likely we should read P. Antistius, tribune in 88 B.c., whom
Cic. praises for eloquence in Brut. 226.

2 legeApuleia “as the Apuleian law provided”. It is probable that
Saturninus, besides his famous lex agran‘a, carried two leges de coloniis
deducendis. The colonies contemplated were settlements of full Roman
citizens, since Aquileia, founded in 181 13.c., was the last of the Latin
colonies. At the foundation of the burgess colonies of Parma, Mutina
and Saturnia in 183 the franchise was conferred, under the provisions
osa law similar to that of Saturninus, on a few Latins, as also in 184
when Potentia and Pisaurum were established. Cf. Brut. 79.

negabat.- the laws of Saturninus were declared invalid by the Senate.
No doubt Marius had exercised his privilege before the declaration was
made, but still it could not reasonably be contended that Matrinius was
entitled to the franchise, when the law on which he tested iiis cialm was
ffept away. The acquittal was probably due wholly to the influence of

nihil similitudinis: the case of Matrinius was so weak that Cic. is
obliged to declare that it bore no resemblance to the case of Balbus.
