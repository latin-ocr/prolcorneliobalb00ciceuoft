with the present tense, the ind. is far commonet than the subj. ‚ but when

the imperfect or pluperfict follows, the indic. is rare (scarce found, if at
all, in Cia), while with the perf. the two moods are about equally

common. With our passage cf. Off. 1, 73 in omnibus negotizk prius quam
aggrediare, adhibenda est praeparatio.

tus: “the point of law involved ’⁹3 so 2, l. 16.

33 communi condiczbne: “a circumstance which affeets one and all of
us ”. For omnium nostrum see n. on Arch. 22, l. 22.

nascendi initio .·=0rtu‚ ⁶ ‘at birth ''. For the periphrasis cf. Seneca,

De otio Sap. 4, 1, (31), quoted by N'agelsbach, ea ⁴res publica cui nos

deberet: “were bound '‘; the present debet which some read would
imply “ is the supposition is, in fact, well founded that, etc.'’ Here how-
ever and below (1. 6) essent, the supposition is looked on as too absurd
to be even imagined admissible.

labor et industria: these words, differing very slightly in meaning
(labor being rather work, industria rather the spirit which prompts
to work), are frequently thus joined, as Imp. Cn. Pomp. 1 (in per-
ferendo labore industriam), ib. 29, Nep. Att. 12, 3. So industria and

> diligentia in Att. 15, 13 A, 3, Nep. Cat. 3, 4.

7 viris bonis: this passage shews the absurdity of the rule which some
scholars set up, that when the epithets boni, optimi follow the noun viri
they always imply contempt, while if the epithets are sincerely used they
precede the noun. (Cf. Kiihner on Tusc. 3, 50.)

9 genere: “descent'’. Exr “starting from''.

10 consecuta est.- notice the verb agreeing with humanitas only of the
three nouus· For multorum humanitas ...... consecuta est=multi leumani-

tate consecuti sunt, cf. 16, 1. 12 res gestae... peragrassent.

u honores: the plur. comes in awkwardly, among the singular nouns,
particularly as summam precedes. Moreover Balbus could not be said
to have held the highest offices (which is the only meaning summos
honores can have) for he had not yet risen above the rank of praefectus

' fabrum in the army. Many years after this speech Cic. is shocked at the

idea of an alien like Balbus intriguing for admission to the Senate (Att.

10, 11, 4). Probably therefore honorem (“publie esteem”) should be

v read.
13 pudorem eius: “a man of such honour”.
