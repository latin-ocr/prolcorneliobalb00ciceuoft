21 statuit: so 18, p. 27, l. 7 constititi condicio.

civibus: fillow citizens 3 concivis is not used in good Latin3 so συμ-
πολίτης scarcely occurs in good Greek.

ut: this goes with ne liceat in 1. 25, the clause being most awkwardly
ἒὲοξξῐι ιδζ 1the insertion of other clauses, one containing another ut.

22 Mag-ni armis adiutoribus tuis: Magni=P0mpei. Adiutoribus tuis is
an ablat. of attendant circumstances (ablative absolute) for which cf. n.
on Arch. 3, 1. ιο, and for the expression 38, 1. 20 adiutoribus illorum
civibus and 26, l. 53 sor the juxtaposition of ablatives cf. Font. 44
multis et firmis praesidiali· vobis adiutoribus z'sa‘z' immani barbariae resis-
temus, so Leg. Agr. 2, 16, and below, 1. 31. Tuis = Gaditanis3 mei, tui,

⁴ nostri, vestri are often so used without cives.

24 senatu, imperatoribus: the sanction of the comitia was theoretically
necessary (Introd. p. 1 1, 13), but is here evidently regarded as practically
unimportant. Halm is probably right in inserting another ut after etiam.

’ 28 inferret: “should thrust himself into''.

auxiliis-.- a regular name for contingents of infantry supplied to the
Roman army by the allied states.

ne quis...et...et: usually in a negative clause aut takes the place of a
single et (as in Arch. 2, l. 18) and aut—aut or neque—neque that of
, ae—et, unless the words connected by the two conjunctions are intended
to be so closely united as almost to form a single idea.

31 periculo suo: above, 1. 3.

avim...iure: aster an adverb it would be more natural and usual
to nd nec iniuria.

33 paterna .· the reading is doubtful ς see Appendix.

ς 26. P. 30.

= 4 rata esse etc.: “ can have no validity''.

nihil magis: irregularly put for nihilo magz‘s; Cic. and the best
writers generally use nihilo multo paulo eo tanto quanto etc. to denote the
measure of excess with comparatives, not the corresponding accusatives.
Livy is the first writer who commonly uses the accusatives. Nihil there-
fore must here be taken as an adverbial accusative=n0n.

6 versari in .· “to engage in'’.

7 post genus hominum natum .· a variation from the usual post homines
nat0s= “ from the beginning of the world''.
9 obiecerint: note the tense ; the meaning is “who actually have

exposed their lives’'. Qui obicerent would be “ who were of such a
nature as to expose etc.’' Cf. Kennedy‚ Gram. 205.

ιι interdisto: sc. omni praemio. Cf. n. on 2 5, 1. 29·
