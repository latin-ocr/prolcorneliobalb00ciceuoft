INTRODUCTION.

a. lee defendant L. C omelias Balbus.

L. CORNELIUS BALBUS was born at Gades in Spain somewhere
about the beginning of the last century B.C. His family held
high rank in the city¹, which was one of the largest and most
flourishing of the Roman empire. Balbus served in the Roman
army during the whole time of the wars in Spain from 79 to
70 B.c.², having gained the friendship of Metellus, Memmius,
and finally of Pompeius himself. The last-named commander,
under the provisions of the lex Gellia Cornelz'a3‚ conferred on
Balbus the Roman franchise. There was a connexion dating
from old timeS, between the town of Gades and the Cornelian
family, and one of the consuls who passed the law was a Cornelius.
These facts led Balbus to adopt the nomen Cornelius, and the
praenomen Lucius was probably assumed in grateful recollection
of the L. Cornelius Lentulus who commanded the Romans in
Spain from 206 to 200 B.C. and had done great services to
Gades⁴ The cognomen Balbus was one of the commonest,
being used by nearly a score of Roman families. The assump-
' tion of this name may have been intended as a mark of'regard
for T. Ampius Balbus, an intimate friend of Pompeius.
