's 15.] NOTES. 59

24 acemimum et maximum: so 5, 1. 30.
2 5 ius illius populi: i.e. that Gades was a foederata czivitas.

interpretationem: the legal construction to be put on the treaty: so
De opt. gen. or. 2ο legum int„ Off. 1 33 iuris, and often (cf. 20, p. 27,
l. 30). Madvig (Opusc. 2, 21) points out that interpretationem can have
here no reference to translation as some edd. have supposed, because all

foedera were written in Latin.

26 non tenebat: “was not in possession of ’'‚ “had not grasped”. So
used in Acad. 2, 26, where it translates καταλαμβάνεσθαι.

'²7 mediocres .· “ ordinary ’'.

. 29 librarioli .· the diminutive here conveys contempt; “ poor clerks'’ or
“the meanest clerks”, but in¹ Att. 4, 4 Β, 1 librarioli is merely colloquial
Latin for librarii. The librarii, especially employed in copying books,
were generally slaves.

scire profiteantur: for the omission of se before scire cf. Acad. r, 18
quid me, inquam, putas, qui philosophiam iam profi’ssm sim populo nos-
tro exhibiturum! It is beyond question that Cic. often omits the pro-
nouns me te se eum eos before an infinitive, when no special emphasis
is required, yet recent editors (most frequently Baiter, but in a less
degree also Halm and Madvig) have tampered with nearly every pas-
sage where such an omission occurs. The verbs after which the omis-
sion is found are usually verbs of thinking or speaking. Material for
studying the 'matter is contained in a note of Kiihner on Tusc. 1, 60.

scientiam in foederibus. this is an excessively rare construction.
Either foederum or the addition of interpretandis (as in Phil. 9, 10 in
legibus interpretandis scientia, like Acad. 2, 3 prudentia in constituendis
civitatibus) would have been natural. Interpretandis is indeed found in
some old edd. The constr. is the more remarkable because the phrase
sciens in aliqua re is not used. Its harshness may be sostened by
taking praestabilem in closely together=quae excellit in foederibus pac-
tionibus condicionibus: the last two words are mere rhetorical varia-
tions on oederibus, from which they are not intended to be sharply
distinguis ed in meaning3 cf. 29, 1. 16. If strictly used pactio would
mean an agreement concluded by a general with the enemy without
distinct authorisation from the Roman people; if such an agreement
related to temporary matters, as for instance a truce, it would be in
itself valid, but if it related to a permanent settlement it would be
invalid without formal ratification. The fhedus moreover was concluded
by the fetiales with elaborate religious formalities, while the pactio was
a simple verbal or written agreement. Foedus and pactio are joined as
here in 29, 1. 17, also De Or. 1, 159, Caec. 513 the following passages
(qu. by Jordan on Caec. 1. 1.) will shew that for rhetorical purposes
