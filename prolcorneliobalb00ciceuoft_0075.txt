C. Laenati: possibly the man who as legatus in the army disgrace-
sully surrendered to a Gaulish force, and had to go into exile, because a
charge of maiestas was brought against him (107 B.C.). But most
likely the ‘praenomen C. is a Mss corruption, for which P. ought to be
substituted. P. Popillius Laenas, the father of the Laenas last named,
was consul in 132 B.C.‚ when he acted with great severity against the
fouowers of Tib. Gracchus, sor which he was driven into exile by
C. Gracchus in ¹23 (cf. Post. red. in Sen. 38, Brut. 128).

Q. Philippo: possibly the son of the commander during the war
against Perseus (ι69 B.C., cf. Liv. 44, 3), but nothing definite is known

of his condemnation and exile.

Nuceriae.- in Campania, a civitas fhederat‘a. The time at which the

illegal exactions there he was condemned to pay a large money-fine
(Verr. 3, 184 and 4, 22). He was afterwards, like many other prominent
Romans, bribed by Iugurtha, and condemned by the special commis-
sion appointed under the Lex Mamilia of·109 to try those involved in

Q. Caepioni: as praetor in 110 triumphed over the Lusitanians; as
consul in 106 took Tolosa (Toulouse) with immense booty, most of which
he appropriated to himself ; as proconsul in 105 commanded an army
against the Cimbri and was mainly responsible for one of the most dis-
astrous defeats the Romans ever suffered, 80‚000 men being lost; on
returning to Rome was stripped of his commission (imperium abrogatmn
est-a very rare proceeding) 3 thrown into gaol by one plebeian tribune,
he was liberated by another and fied to Smyrna. His history, however,
is in many points obscure. According to some authorities, the exile
came. later, in 95 B-C. and followed on a condemnation for embezzling

the Toulouse booty.

P. Rutilio: consul in 105 B.c.; went as legatus with Q. Mucius
Scaevola to Asia, which province he governed some time as proconsul
with thorough purity and uprightness. By repressing the illegal extor-
tions of the tax-collectors he incurred the hatred of the equestrian body,
so that he was unjustly arraigned and condemned. He lived many years
at Smyrna, and declined an offer made by Sulla to reinstate him at
Rome. He was excellent as soldier, orator and man of letters.

postlimimb: when a Roman became a slave, through being cap-
tured in war by the enemy, he underwent the capitis· deminutio maxima,
and ceased to be a citizen, but if he became free again he regained all
bis former rights iure postliminii “by right οἱ Subsequent return’', as

’, the phrase went.
