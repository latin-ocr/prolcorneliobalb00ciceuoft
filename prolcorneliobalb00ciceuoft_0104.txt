100 PRO BALBO.

ments of preceding scholars. In Prof. Mayor’s “Bibliographical Clue
to Latin Literature'', and in Teuffel’s History only one essay subsequent
to that of Madvig is mentioned—Biichner’s “Annotationes criticae ad
orationem Pro Balbo '’ (Schwerin 1866). I have found it pretentious and
worthless. Scattered about in various quarters I have come across a
few critical comments by Cobet, Pluygers and others, but such aids to
the study of the text are few and far between.

The reasons for most of the spellings adopted are 'given in Appendix
B to my edition of the speech Pro Archia. When they are to be found
there they will not be repeated here.

Genitives sing. of proper names in ·z'us end in -ἰ not -z'i. ΒΚ print
-z‘i everywhere in this speech though the weight of MSS testimony is
strongly in favour of -z‘. Here are the passages where the MSS read
the true form. CORNELI: PG¹ E in 56, 1. 21; PG¹ in 1, 1. 2; 6, l. 143
18, p. 26,1. 333 58, 1.8: Pl in 6, p. 22,1. 32; 43,1. 4; P in 19, 1. 22:
G1 in 65, p. 46, 1. 5. In 58, l. 7 the reading of E, Cornelia aut, also
points to Corneli, so does that of Pl, Cornelio, in 65, p. 46, 1. 5, the o
being due to the proximity of maleficzo. POMPEI: C in 13, 1. 11 ;
PG¹Ein 11,1.29; 13,1.8;51,1. 13 65, p. 46‚1. 6: P²GE in6, p.23‚1.9.
MARI: PGl in 46, l. 133 49, 1. ¹3· In 56, 1. 27 the confused readings
of the MSS all speak for Vennoni Vindici rather than Vennonii Vindicii.
In only one place, 18, p. 27, 1. 12, the MSS all give a form in ·ii, viz.
Cornelii.

Genitives sing. of neuter nouns in -z'um end in -i not -izz The MSS
have far less frequently preserved the true form than in the case of the
proper names. This may be due to the fact that the nominatives of the
neuter nouns were more familiar to the copyists than those of the proper
names, and so the genitives were more easily made to conform to the
grammar rules current at the time. Yet we find the following exx. of
the form in -ι’. Ρ1 has consili in 11, 1. 29; imperi in 13, 1. 7: P has
consili in 13, 1. 16; 19, 1. 25: aerari in 61, 1. 13. All the MSS give the
form in -iz‘ in 4,1. 13 and 15, p. 26, l. 7 (indicam in 4, 1. 13 (beneficii);
in 5, l. 18 and 17,1. 3ο (officz'z'); in 6, p. 23,1. 13 (proelii); in 13,1. 1· ;
34,l. 27; 39,1. 33; 49,1.19; 51,1. 12 (z'mpm'i); 111 38,1. 21 (praemii33
in 38, 1. 14 (consilz‘i); 1, l. 6 (ingenii).

N ouns, adjectives and participles whose gen. plur. ends in -ium make
is not es in acc. plur. masc. and fem. The letters z· and e are perpetually
confused even in P, yet C give testzzv in 42, 1. 33, expertis in 20, 1. 333 PG
civis in 42,1. 33 and civis fortis in 51, 1. 18 ; Ρ omnis in 16,1. 12 and
58, l. 193 civis in 30, 1. 26 and 49, 1. 17; praesentis in 44, l. ²23 ignor-

MSS testimony is with regard to -tz, -ci may be seen from the following
exx. P has mendatio in 5, 1. 24 ; puericiae in 9, l. 3‘1; saentencia in
