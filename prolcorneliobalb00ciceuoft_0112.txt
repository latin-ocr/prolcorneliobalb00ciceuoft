108 PRO BALBO.

quid...Camertium were transferred here from 46.—l. 28 servos novem
Gaditanos: MSS eros whence Halm (from eros vnu) Erosium Gadi-
tanum. Servos is my correction.

ἓ 51, 1. 17 cuius civitatis sit: B for P cuiatis-siet, GE civitatis· siet:
Orelli cuiati' siet, as though the words were those of Ennius; Halm
cuius enim quisque civitatis sia-1. 18 lzoa’ie .· Halm for C hoc.

ξ 54, 1. 17 atque gravissimi: so I write for MSS a gravissimi, edd.
mostly et g. Orelli wrote ac g„ but ac is not found before a guttural in
Cic—l. 19 ius: Madv. sor C his; but I doubt the construction thus
given (see my n.). Probably eis should be read, with this sense, ‘⁶ nor
was this (the fact that they had acquired the civitas by prosecution) made
a subject of reproach to them'’.—l. 24 iudiciorum.- C and edd. iudicum;
see m n.

ἓ ζ7, 1. 31 Clustuminam.- so MSS here and elsewhere in Cic.-
l. 33 praetoriam .· Halm senatoriam, which is objectionable on two
grounds; (1) senatoria sententia is a meaningless phrase. and (2) it is
certain that 110 one could get into the Senate by a successful prosecution, Ἴ
though if there already he might rise to a higher grade-

ἓ 58, 1. 17 nostris vestrisque .· MSS vestris nostrisque. Many emen-
dations have been made ; Madvig nostris lacrimisque, leaving out lacri-
mis below. ’

ἓ 60, 1. 7 proficit: P1 proficitur here and in 1. 8, possibly rightly.

§6ss l. 13 novo: Manutius sor MSS novem, which Halm thinks a
gloss.

ἓ 64, 1. 14 et fhmiliarissimum .· om. P.
