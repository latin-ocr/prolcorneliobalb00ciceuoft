nature sacrosancta1. It is very difficult to see why such a
clause was inserted. Probably, like other clauses in Roman

enactments, it had become a mere empty form2. Cicero has no

ὲ difficulty in-shewing that evenis the clause be taken literally‚
it does not apply to the foedus of Gades, which was informal
ζ and never sanctioned by the Roman people, though in practice
allowed validity. He then shews that even if the Gaditane
treaty had been sormally ratified there was no clause in it for-
bidding the Romans to enfranchise a Gaditane3. The provisions
' of the treaty are then examined, though in all probability not
completely4, and an erroneous interpretation put by the pro-
secutor upon one of the wordgis refuted.

ἐξ 38-44. “There is no need to argue the question whether
the treaty with Gades prevents Rome from ensranchising
Balbus', for the Gaditanes themselves, who alone would have a
right to complain if that were the case, are on the side of
Balbus, The people of Gades are doing all they can to get the
principle established that it is lawful for any individual among
thern to serve Rome and win the citizenship. They fine the
prosecutor, they send a deputation to speak for Balbus, who has
done so much for them.'’

ἐξ 45—51. “The precedents all support the action of Pom-
peius in the case of Balbus. Marius and many other generals
have bestowed the citizenship on persons belonging to civitates
foederatae, without their right to do so being questioned⁵.''

ἓξ 52- 5 5. ‘.‘ The action of the Roman government and
courts in particular instances has been uniformly in favour of
such bestowal of the franchise. No one who received the boon
from a Roman general has ever been deprived of it by verdict of
a court. Rome was bound by a foedus with the LatinS, yet many
Latins by successful prosecutions became Roman citizens⁶; it is
absurd to suppose that our ancestors would deny to the warrior
