APPENDIX ΟΝ THE TEXZ 107

Α publicae, ii. It is absolutely necessary to understand Poenorum of the
CarthaginianS, not of the Punians in general, in spite of Madvig's protest.
(unfounded, Ι believe) that sensu Poenorum cannot mean sensu in or erga
Poenos. Cic. cannot have meant to say that the Gaditanes had turned
away their minds from every feeling natural to people of Punian race3
moreover, unless the Carthaginians are meant, the words ad nostrum im·
perium etc. have no meaning. Madvig thinks that before inferrentur
some ablative with ab has fallen out, denoting an enemy of Rome other
than the Carthaginians. Ι have added eos before moenibus to suit my
diametrioally opposite view of the passage.

ψ S 40, l. 3 Flaccos .· C Horatios, altered by Garatoni.—Crassos .· C
‘have Cassios, altered by Manutius (so in 52, 1. 27 E has Crasso). The
mention of the name Brutos suggested to an early copyist the name
Horatios associated with it in early, and Cassios in later Roman history,
land no doubt the fact that the poet Horace's name was Flaccus in-
fluenced the reading—1. 9 fuerint : P fuerit and ΒΚ mistakenly3 for si
qui ought then to be si quis or else a noun like civis ought to be inserted.

541, l. 23 audita: CBK inaudita. Though Cic. does occasionally
use the verb inaudio (Plautine indaudio) the use, I believe, belongs solely
to the Epistles and to distinctly colloquial passages elsewhere, as is the
case with so many Plautine expressions found in Cic. Moreover he is
not likely to have used the ambiguous participle. Ι therefore hold in to
*be an addition, and strike it out. —ne forte .· my correction for C fore (omit-
ting ne), Lamb. ΒΚ fore ut.—l. 24 gravissima .· after this P has autem,
G¹E hoc (an evident conjecture). The a of autem is a doubling of the
last letter of gravissima, the utem a wrong writing of istum 3 the word
should therefore be ejected. Halm ΒΚ keep it and suppose a lacuna
(relating to Balbus) before gravissima—1. 24 in senatu convicia: so I
have written for C senatus, Pl convita, P2G convitia, E convicia, ΒΚ
consulta (after old edd. ). It seems unlikely that the Gaditanes should
have fulminated a number of senatus consulta against the man.

ἓ 4¹2, l. 26 delectaris .· C and edd. delectare, the use of which form in
Cic. for the second person sing. present indicative, I very much doubt.
—l. 31 poena notavit: so B for C poenatavit.

5 43, 1. 9 affecerit: before this Rau <followed by K) with great pro-
bability inserts ut ; see my n.

546, l. 7 religione? is igitur Iguvinatem: so Halm for MSS reli-
gionis igitur aequitate (P equitate). In l. 26 PlGE have [gytinatium‚ but
the regular form is Iguvini for the inhabitants of Iguvium—l. 9 summa .·
C om.; but praeditus virtute alone is scarcely Ciceronian Latin—idem...
donavit.- C om. 3 supplied by Madv.

547, l. 15 quem iam: Halm for PG quoniam, E quem. Quoniam
here is no doubt due to quoniam in the line above.—l. 19 legisset: so
old edd. and ΒΚ for C egisset. In the Addenda to Orelli ed. 2 Halm
has this curious note, “sort. si tanta bella gessisset, ut tandem foeda illa
non correctio sed depravatio expellatur.'’ What is the meaning of “si
tanta bella gessisset quanta et gessit et conficit ” ? Baiter si legatus obisset.
The mss reading is almost demonstrated to be sound by Imp. Cn. Pomp.
28 plura bella gessit quam ceteri legerunt.
