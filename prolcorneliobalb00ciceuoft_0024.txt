20 INTRODUCTJON.

what they gave to the pleader. The laws under which these
Latins became cives were never adopted by the Latin towns,
and even under the lex Licinia Mucia, whereby those who
had falsely assumed the citizenship were ejected, these Latius
were left unmolested. The priestesses of Ceres also were always
Greeks from treaty-bound states, who were enfranchised by
special act.'⁷

ἐξ 56—65. Cicero now declares that so long a speech has
been needful, not for the purpose of convincing the jury, but to
break the spirit of all those who for various reasons are envious
of Balbus. Those who are merely envious of his personal suc-
cess are not difficult to quiet, since he has no real enemies.
Those who are attacking him most bitter1y‚ are attacking Pom-'
peius through him, and if well advised will abandon such an
unequal contest. Political enmities ought not to be everlasting.
ln his own person he has abandoned the enmity once existing
between himself and Caesar.

The defence made by Cicero is pretty complete, though, as we
haye seen, there are some unsatisfactory points about it. As he
has somewhat obscured the lines of the prosecutor's speech, Ι will
conclude by restoring these so far as is possible. (1) Pompeius
had no right to enfranchise Balbus, since the lex Gellia Cornelici
had never been adopted by Gades, as other enfranchising laws,
such as the lex Iulia, were by the states they affected. (2) The
law itself contained a provision that public‘obligations of a
sacrosanct character were not to be affected by it. Now a foedus
is essentially a sacrosanct obligation. (3) Many foedera contain
an express provision that no citizen of the foederati populi con-
cerned in thern should become a citizen of Rome. These lines
were filled out with the usual amount of personal abuse, in
which the hunt of Balbus after wealth and social position, his
adoption by Theophanes, his grand mansion, his passage into
the tribus Clustumina by the harsh method of a prosecution
were placed in an invidious light.
