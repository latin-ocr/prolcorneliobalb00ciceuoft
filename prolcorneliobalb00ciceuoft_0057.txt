ιο esset...repudianda.· Cic. seems often to take pains to separate by a
considerable space parts of the verb esse from the participles or gerun-
dives to which they belong. Cf. Att. 5, 1, 3 quae fixeramus ego et tu
mter nos de sorore in Tusculano locuti ; also beloxv, 21, 1. 14.

ab is comparatively rare, and of the instances found the great majority
occur in Cic. Roby (Pref. to Gram. Vol. 11. p. lxxv.) gives a list,
which is however capable of considerable extension; additional exx.
will be found under ab in Merguet’s Lexicon to the Speeches of Cic„ in s
Jordan’s n. on Caec. 33, and in Madvig’s n. on Fin. 2, 30. The usage
is probably not nearly so rare outside Cic. as Roby’s list would make it
appear. ΤῙιε same scholar in ἓ 1147 of his Grammar explains many

- examples by the desire of the writer to avoid ambiguity‚ many others
by the desire to balance clauses neatly, while he allows that many

29 hic ego nunc cuncter: for the reading see Appendix. Cuncter is the
so-called deliberative subjunctive.

30 abest.·=deest, deficit, in which sense abesse takes the dat. not uncom-
monly. Halm (on Sull. 14, where the reading afuerim given by MSS is
quite right) makes a slip when he says that Cic. does not use abesse with
dat. ; cf. N. D. 2, 37, De Or. 2, 281, Leg. 1, 5 Huic homini: sc. Pompeio.

haec: “this privilege” (of conferring the citizenship on whom he
leases). There is‘ no need to read lzoc (as some edd. do), since the
{atius constantly used the neut. plur. of pronouns where we should
be inclined to use the sing.; so also the Greeks used ταῦτα sor τοῦτο.
Observe how Cic. tries to break the strength of the opposite case by
setting in a brilliant light the achievements of Pompeius, before he
attacks the legal question involved. All this part of the speech is really
extra causam (cf. n. on Arch. 31, 1. 28). For Cic.’s motives in thus
eulogising PompeiuS, see Introd. p. 10.

tribui et concedi: so tribui concedique in Arch. 4, 1. 16, where see n.,
also cf. the frequent conjunction in Cic. of remittere and concedere, as
