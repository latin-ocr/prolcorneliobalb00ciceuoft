APPENDIX ΟΝ ΤΗΕ ΤΕΧΤ.

α. General remarks.

Noth‘ like a complete apparatus criticus can be given here, since
the chiefffiough not the only) object aimed at is to give junior students
some idea how the text is worked out from the MSS, reasons being given
for the most important alterations.

My text is mainly founded on that of Baiter, who edited the speech
for the second edition of Orelli’s Cicero (Ziirich, 1856). The evidence
for every reading has been well weighed before the reading has been
allowed to pass. 1 have availed myself of all the critical comments on
the text to which Ι could obtain access. In a number of passages Ι
have felt obliged to abandon Baiter's readings and adopt those of other
scholars. In the critical comments on the following places suggestions
of my own will be found (some of which have been printed in my text)
viz. 3,1. 233 5, L 163 6,1. 32 (bis); 8, 1. 24; 9, l. 93 14, 1. 21;14‚l.
25318,l. 113 19, l. 24; 25,1. 223 25, 1. 293 27, 1. 193 31, 1. 243 32,
.l. 315 ib. L 23 33,1. 7;33, 1. 10 (bz's); 33, 1. 18339,1. 243 41, 1. 23
(bis); 41, 1. 243 422 1. 263 50, 1. 28; 54‚1.17; 5421- 193 54,1. 24; 60,

l· xBait6eigsl-tgait· is founded mainly on three MSS. The most important

(called by him P) is at Paris and is commonly assigned to the ninth cen—
tury, but has interpolations by a later hand, of about the twelfth. Next
in authority is G (codex Gemblacensis) now at Brussels, and pronounced
to belong to the twelsth century. The third is the codex Erfurtensis
denoted by E 3 it is now at Berlin. Its readings for the most part agree
witl(i3 those of G. When P G E agree Baiter denotes the consensus

y The most recent text of the speech for Balbus is that by Kayser in
Vol. v. of the Tauchnitz edition of Cicero, edited by himself and Baiter.
This text generally differs but slightly from that of Baiter3 in one respect
-orthography—it is immensely better.

In the notes that follow, 1 shall use Baiter’s marks, and shall denote
his text by B, that of Kayser by K. P1, G¹‚ Ε1 denote that the reading
is in the hand of the original writer of the MS ; 1³² etc. that the reading
is in a later hand.

Of critical essays on the text that of Madvig in his Opuscula (11. pp.
¹4- 34) is facile princeps. It has rendered obsolete most of the com·
