104 PRO BALBO.

§ ¹.5’ l. 3² eius: edd. for C et; eius has first been written ei (ci cm·
for cuius, n. on 14 ,.1 25, som 52. 1. 31 GE mutanda ei for mutandae ius)
then changed to et, for which seen. on 5, 1. 19. -1. 3 libri: Clibm‘3 Bake
li'brarzi (cf. lzbrarioli in 14, 1. ι29) which does not suit litterae below. —-
l. 6 vitiis.- Madv. for P ut iar, C citius. Later C have inquam, as
above, 9, 1. 4 inquit for cui.

ἓ 1,6 l. 15 inauditis honoribus singulamhusque: edd. for C in sin-
gularibusque.—1. 18 niterent: old em. for niterentur ; the addition and
omission of ur to verbal forms are frequent; so Arch. ἓ 23 the MSS have
continet sor continentur. —1. 20 huius visa atque perspecta.- so Halm
most ingeniously for C huius atque. For perspecta C have perjecta3 so
in 5,1. 19 G1E conflet sor constet.

§18, 1.32 ac: Pat3 cf. Arch. 2, 1. 16n. B(see K» ed1tedac but
afterwards preferred at, wrongly. -1. 6 poena essent: edd for C
or pene sunt. —l. 11 honores· . so C· , but probably honorem should be

⁴ read ; see my n.

ξ 19, 1. ι8 poeniendam.- PE poenitendam, G² pem‘tendam3 cf. Αν-
clzita for Archia in Arch. 18. Edd. before Orelli puniendam3 the
other form however is well attested, as may be seen from Neue.-l. 24
ita...sanctum.· C satis-...sancti which cannot be justified by such
phrases as satis esse causae in 5, 1. 18. Edd. read satis esse sanctum,
where satis is not wanted, as Madv. and others point out. Ι have
therefore written ita ς if the 3 at the end of videmus were written twice,
the transition to satis would be easy. Ita...ut is explanatory in Cic. as
well as limitative.

ἓ 20, 1. 4 populus Romanus: C praetor, which was written pra by
contraction, as was populus Romanus3 see n. on 5, 1. 16 ; 10, l. 19.

, [ἓ 22, 1. 30 periculosis-.- Madv. for C periculam Orelli in pen’·
cu zs.

ἓ 23, l. 3 laboris...c0mmeatus .· Lambin. and others labore...com-
meatu, making all four substantives parallel to one another. The
phrase periculo suo is against this; see my n.

ἓ 25, 1. 22 Magni armis adiutoribus tuis.- so Ι correct the mss
reading magnis adiutombus tuis armis. The sumame Magni being
unfamiliar to the copyists was easily changed to mao nis, and armis mis-
placed. The omission of civibus after tuis (to which Madv. objects,
proposing zllis for tuis) 15 natural after ci'vibus 111 the line above. Halm
proposes with much confidence (Addenda to Orelli ed. 2) magnis adiu-
toribus illis usi armis subegimus, comparing 25, 1. 293 26, l. 53 38, l. 20.
Ι cannot believe that Cic. would say mag-nis· adiuto’rz·bus, meaning

‘important allies” though Vell. Pat. 2, 127 has the very expression,
as Halm points out. Klotz adz·ut0m·l›us maioribus tuis, which sails to
account for magma—l. 24 etiam ab imperatoribus.- P has per for ab3
GE per imperatores which is not likely, since the generals are active and
not mere consenting parties, like the nation (per populum Romanum 111

non d., in 63, p. 45, l. 67and 52, l. 30 G 0111. non. Perhaps ut nobis
liceret uti is the right reading. —l. 3 3 palerna.- so PG, E patriag Halm
