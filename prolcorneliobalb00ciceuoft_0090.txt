86 PRO BALBO. - [§ 46- Ι

11 sanctzksimqu. unless Cic. really wrote antiquissimum, the word
alludes to the constant harping of the prosecutor upon the word sa-
crosanctum ; cf. 39, l. 29 speciem foederis omni sanctiorem arce.

12 ut: limitative; “without the action of Marius being stigmatized”;
Cic. often makes the sense clearer by putting ita in the preceding clause.
For the proeeeding of Marius see Introd. p. 13. ’

ξ 4⁷.

¹4 cogitatione: “imagination’'‚ a common meaning and one which ⁶
διάνοια often has ς cf. 9, p. 24, 1. 1 1 cogitaverunt.

com-fficiam mentibus: so animo videre in Fam. 6, 3, cernere in Aoed.
2, 22.

16 foederis: the sing. because the treaty with Camerinum is especially
meant. *v

18 eruditum: in Sall. Iug. 85 Marius says quae illi litteris ego mHi'tando
didici. ’ Μ. was legatus to Metellus in the earlier part of the war against
Iugurtha, and again to P. Rutilius Lupus (consul 90) during the first
part of the Social wari

19 legisset: n. on Arch. 28, l. 16 ς “if he had had a mere book-know·
ledge of wars like those which he waged'’. See Appendix.

20 l {lt-totiens...fuit: he died a few days after entering on his seventh con-
su s lp.

23 quo minus: a very unusual variation for ne, which is in 32, l. 29;
cf. Leg. Agr. 2, 21 lex adfinis excipit ne..., ib. 2, 24 Cn. Pompeius
excipitur ne..., and so Att. 6, 1, 6, Varro Rust. 2, 3, 7, Quintil. 5, 12,
14. If aliquid had been inserted before exceptum the construction would
not have been strange3 the notion of prevention which exceptum intro·

dueed gave rise to quo minus ς cf. impedimur quo minus in 37, p. 35, 1. 7.·

ας· de civitate quaestio: cf. the Athenian διαψήφισις.

28 Licinia et Mucia: passed by the consuls of 95 B-C., Crassusfthe great
orator, and Scaevola (called pontifex), to prevent aliens from exercising
the rights of citizens at Rome. A quaestio extraordinaria was held, and
those convieted were ejected stom Rome and returned to their native
towns; see Off. 3, 47, Brut. 63. The socii and Latini, large numbers
of whom resided at Rome, were deeply aggrieved, and the law did
more than anything else to bring about the Social war. Cf. fragm. 10
of Cic. ’s speech Pro Cornelio legem Liciniam et Muciam de civibus redi·
gundis...video constare inter omnes non modo inutilem, sed pernicio-mm

rei publicae fuisse.

29 in iudicium vocatus .· 7, l. 8.
