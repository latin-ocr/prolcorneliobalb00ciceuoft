ι auctoritates: “there are in Latin 3814 abstract nouns, of which 2889

occur only in the sing., 925 also in the plur.” Draeger, Hist. Synt.
1, 9. Cic. uses these abstract plurals in overwhelmingly larger propor-
tion than any other author. Here, as often, the plur. has reference

to a concrete plur.‚viz. patronorum: so Verr. 3, 4, 7 industrias (so Mss)
hominum novorum.
ἰ Corneli: for gen. in —i see Appendix.
usus: plur. like auctoritates, ingenia, studia.

3 ingenia.- cf. Arch. 1, l. 1.

studia: “ devotion ”-

mmmmm.- n. in my ed. of Arch. p. 80. The succeeding cum is un-
pleasant to a modern ear, but such repetitions are common in Latin ; so

Arch. 6, 1. πο, Sull. 6, etc.

partes: always used in the plur. in this sense, by good writers.
Quintilian first uses the sing. Cf. Mur. 6 lzas partis lenitatis et miseri-

cordiae.
igitur: if any part of esse forms the second word in a sentence, igitur,
like enim and other patrueles, is very often thrown back to the third place.
6 vos: zze. the Roman people, represented by the audienee3 “just so
much influence as you have determined 1 should possess’'.

7 nam: the force of this is not at first sight clear; it is ellipfic, and
anticipates an objection: “do not misunderstand me, for, etc.'’ Cf.

Arch. 23, 1. 27, n.

8 ego: note the emphatic position of the word.

alio loco: sc. dicam, i.e. in§ 58. The ellipse of dicere or other verb

of the same meaning is exceedingly common in Cic. ; cf. 42, 1. 22 and
Off. ’3, 120 sed de hoc alio loco pluribus: nunc ad propositum. Many exx.

are collected in N'agelsbach, Stilistik ἓ 183, 1, and Draeger 1, 174.
