de consili-sententia: “after consulting his advisers''; so in 19, 1. ἰ 5.
At Rome eustom in all cases, and law in many cases, required that de·
cisions on important matters should not be taken by public officers or
even by patres familiarum, without consultation with those best qualified
to advise them. Hence Cic. says severely of the commissioners to be
nominated under the agrarian law of Rullus—orbis terrarum cognitio
datur sine consilio (Leg. Agr. 2, 33). Skilled lawyers were in request
for every consilium. The phrase de consili sententia was a regular part

- of every decree issued by a praetor or provincial governor.

33 publice: “in court ”.

ut mos Graecorum est: it must be remembered that in the Athenian
legal procedure the evidence was all reduced to writing ere the case came
before the jury, who as a rule heard no oral evidence. The deposition
of the witness being read over to the jury, he went up to the altar (πρὸς
τὸν λίθον) to affirm sormally on oath all that was contained in it. [A rae,
like altaria, is often used of a single altar.] In Roman trials oral evidence
was the mle, and the witness took an oath in court before giving evidence.
The words ut mos Graecorum est call attention to this difference between
the Roman and the Greek mode of giving evidence.
