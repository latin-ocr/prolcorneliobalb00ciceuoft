tizbrunss. The connexion of Balbus with Caesar was of the
utmost advantage to Gades². A new quarter was laid out by
Balbus andCaesar, which soon rivalled in importance the old
city⁸. The political and legal system there underwent a thorough
reform4. The powerful influence of Caesar at Rome was also
productive of great benefit to the Gaditanes‚ and in 49 Β. C. they
received from him the gift of the Roman cz·vz·tas⁵. At some
time anterior to the speech of Cicero, the Gaditanes, in gratitude
’ for all the advantages they had received from or through Balbus,
appointed him their patronus at Romess.

As early as 60 Β. C: Balbus had become the private secretary
of Caesar, and his confidential political agent, a character which
he retained till his patron’s death. He had a great share in the
negotiations which resulted in the first triumvirate⁷‚ and during
the campaigns in Gaul Caesar often sent him to Rome to manage
politieal affairs.

It was to be expected that a naturalised foreigner who was
so prominently before the public at Rome, who was high in the
favour of all the members of the triumvirate, and who was
rapidly rising in honour and in wealth, should find many
enemies. There were not a few among the leading politicians
of the day who bore him no good will. Their hostility led in 56
B.C. to the prosecution which produced the speech now before
us. The circumstances and merits of the case will be examined
later. Although the history of Balbus in the time Subsequent to
the prosecution does not closely concern uS‚ it will be convenient
to know its leading facts.

During the remainder of Caesar’s wars in Gaul Balbus con-
tinued for the most part with him, but occasi onally visited Rome.
He endeavoured to pay the debt he owed to Cicero for his defence,
by drawing the orator nearer to Caesar, and also by advancing
the fortunes of Quintus, the orator's brother, who was then on
