102 PRO BALBO.

spectanti in 12, p. 25, 1. 2. 1. 19 de ipso.- many edd. de se¹ ipso, mis-
takenly; see my n. and ef. Madvig on Fin. 1, 67.

ἓ 3, 1. 23 recte cadere.- so I alter Mss tractare. Madvig gave recte se
dare (so ΒΚ) for which he quoted Ter. Hec. 3, 3, 2ο, poeta ap. Cic.
N. D. 3, 26 but from Cic. himself only Att. 3, 23, 15 ut se initia dede·
rint ; in which passage probably se should be struck out and ceciderint
read for dederint3 cf. the very next letter (3, 24, 2) llaec res quemad-
modum ceciderit. This use of se dare requires more confirmation from
Cic. Weissenborn rejects it in Liv. 28, 5, 9; it is found in Verg. (Georg.
1, 287) Seneca Rhetor, Statius and other late writers.

ἓ 4, 1. 6 extremus: PG curiously exercitus, E ex merely. K says
om. B (ed. Veneta 1472)fhrt. recte; see however my n.—l. 15 actorem:
so P2GEK3 P1B auctorem. See n.

ἓ 5. l. 16 re publica: PG¹E rei merely, G² re merely. Old edd.
took rei as gen. of reus, which was‘ objectionable both on the
score of sense and on that of syntax 3 see my n. The mistake arose
from the contractiori rep. for re publica ; possibly however populo Ro·
mano should be read; cf. 10, 1. ¹9 where C have reio. for populo Ro·
mano and 13, 1. 7 o populi Romani excellens dimitam—l. 19 ei: so G,
but in an erasure; PE et which if genuinezetiam3 et and ei are often
interchanged; below, in 9, 1. 3ο C have et before tribuet—1. 26 sataur:
GE fateatur, a sort os error extremely common; C have in 19, 1. 24
videamus, in 22, 1. 24 videatur, in 36, l. 2 5 sucatum—1. 29 Karthagine

“vient to take possession of Carthggo nova sor the Romans'' is most
unlikely; Madvig's is the best of many emendations.

ἓ 6. 1. 32 propm'a .· so Klotz for C proelia, which Madv. simply
omits, retaining talis 'before labor. In support of propria see quotations

ρίείαει my emendation for Pl tas, Ρ2 talis (so edd. mostly)2 GE hic,
Halm tantus. I should like to see support sor the constr. labor in rem
publicam; for insumere laborem in aliquam rem (Cic. Inv. 2, 38) is a
different thing. F urther the four words labor assiduitas dimicatio virtus
evidently ought to be taken in pairs, after a fashion of which Cic. is
particularly fond, i. e. labor assiduitas go together, and dimicatio virtus
together3 cf. 36, 1. 29 comes benigni, faciles suaves. This cannot be
done if labor is construed with the preceding words. If pietas be
objected to, merita might be read; cf. Orator 133 merita in rem pub·
lz‘cam.—l. 6 nulla nisi Jamae: so Orelli and ΒΚ for Ρι nulla si famae
(P2 om. si), G samem, E samam. On Orelli's reading Madvig (Op. 2,
18) makes the somewhat weak remark “concinnitas membrorum inter se
relatorum hanc adiectionem (seemingly the words nisi firmae) vix patitur.”
—1. 10 est: B for C sit, one of the cOmmonest of changes, arising from
the writing natust ; found several times in this speech; e. g. 62, l. 24
susceptum sit is in C. Cf. Madv· onr Fin. 3, 58. '

ἓ 7. l. 15 igitur est.- E om. est3 this is very common; cf. Arch.
p. 75.—l. 16 donavit.- misled by donavit in 1. 18 E om. all from this
to oui si in l. 19 3 similarly GE om. nostris before cum in 1. 123 cf. also
