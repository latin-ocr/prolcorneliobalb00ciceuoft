prominent weakness of Cic.’s prose style—his tendeney to repeat a
statement in slightly different terms; so 9, p. 24, 1. 4 casus eventusque,
18, p. 27, 1. 5 labor et industria.

31 ususne rerum ? sc. bellicarum .· “ experience in military service ’θ’
So res gestae generally means “ military history '’.

qui etc..· the sentence is really elliptic 3 supply something like
eine abest usus rerum ἕ) This ellipse gives an abrupt energy to the
question, which makes it a favourite rhetorical device. Cf. Acad. 2,
115, also Liv. 3, 39, 9 cuius illi partis essent rogitare. Populares?
Quid enim eos per populum egisse? Optimates? qui anno iam prope
senatum non habuerint?

pueritiae etc. .· cf. Imp. Cn. Pomp. 28 (the whole of which*
passage should be closely compared with this) qui extrema pueritia
miles in exercitu fuit summi imperatoris, ineunte adulescentia maximi
ipse exercitus imperator.

3 3 minus saepe etc. .· cf. Imp. Cn. Pomp. 2⁶8 plura bella gessit quam
celeri legerunt.

P. 24.

3 genera bellorum: cf. Imp. Cn. Pomp. 1. 1. quod denique genus esse
belli potest in quo illum non exercuerit fortuna rei publicae?

an : following on ususne above.

4 cui etiam ipsi .· etiam is to be taken not with cui but with {psi which
agrees with casus.
'non duces sed comites: i. e. his plans determined the course of events,

and were not themselves determined by it. Dux and comes are thus
oftencontrasted, e. g. F laec. 5, Marcell. 11, Lael. 96 (in some edd. ).

5 in quo uno: n. on 6, p. 23, 1. 5.

fortuna : in choosing a commander the Romans attached great im-
portance to his reputation for good luck. Sulla prided himself on the
title Felix. For the felicitas and egregia fhrtunaof Pompeius see Imp.
Cn. Pomp. 47, 48, 49.

fortuna certavit: cf. Arch. 24, 1. ιο.
7 pudor etc..· Pompeius is brilliantly contrasted with the corrupt
generals of the time in Imp. Cn. Pomp. 36 sq.
8 requisita est .·=desiderata est 3 “ was ever looked for in vain? ’⁹

provinciae: Cic. very frequently alludes to the abstention of Pom-
peius from the almost universal practice among generals of the time,
of robbing the provincials. He remarks especially (Flacc. 57) that
when P. captured Jerusalem he took nothing from the Temple.

9 liberi populi: here=peoples who govemed themselves-under traety
ἶνὲξξιοὲοζῖεέ ⁷obeying neither kings nor the Roman provincial rulers; cf.
ιο sanctiorem: Arch. 18, p. 28, l. 9.

ιι sperando-optando .· sperare is to look forward to what is practi-
cable, and may be attained in the ordinary course of events, optare
