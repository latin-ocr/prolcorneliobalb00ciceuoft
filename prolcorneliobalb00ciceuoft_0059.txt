to look fon-ward to what can only happen by some extraordinary stroke
of good fortune. Cf. Att. 8, 15 Α, 1 (a letter written by Balbus
himself) velim idem Pompeius faciat, qm· ut adduci tali tempore ad
ullam condzkionem possit, magis opto quam spero, cf. ib. 1 1, 19, 1 cogis me
sperare quod optandum vix est. Hence optare is sometimes “ to indulge
in wild dreams ”, as in Acad. 2, 121 somnia baec censet Democriti non
docentis sed optanta, where see my n. Translate here “ have imagined
either in their hopes or their dreams ”.

necessagrily a refusal), as also in 17, l. 28. The phrase was originally
legal: see Caec. 81 and 82, with Jordan's n. The historical reference
is to the appointment of Pompeius, with extraordinary powers, to take
command in the East against the pirates. This command P. pretended
to dislike (Dio Cassius 36, 8), a pretence which had the effect of
increasing the popular clamour for his appointment and rendering
easier the adoption of the law which conferred on lum such unparalleled
powers.

the ne (when expressed) and the an are in different sentences (so Arch.

Cluent. 94 (ne, an, an vero), Verr. 3, 194 (utrum—an vero).
