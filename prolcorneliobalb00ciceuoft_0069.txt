θη] NOTES. 65

amatis .· here “ constitution '’.
qui ascribat: qui musal, “since he etc-'⁹3 ascribat “ attaches ω’·-

Ρ. 28.

1 imperitius: the adverb, like peritius in 2, l. 17, imperitissime in 27,
. ι.

1 oportere: i.e. if they mean to get any advantage out of a particular
aw.

foederatorum—liberorum: see Introd. p. 17.
totum hoc etc..· “this whole practice'’ (τῖε. that whereby populi

fiebant fundi) “was ever grounded on this principle and this intention,

that etc.”

imsisset: a lex (strictly so called) is a populi iussum. When a law was
voted the question put to the voters began velites iubeatisne.

socii...Latini: Introd. p. 17.

ea...eadem.· a pleonasm of a sort very common in Latin, and caused

by the striving after clearness. So ille and is, or ille and lzz'c, or qui and

{nile3 5or quignld gie, are often subjects of the same verb ; so ea is repeated
, p. 2 , . .

haberemus: note the continuance of the action implied by the imperf„
as opposed to the pluperfects.

tamquam infundo resedisset: “had established itself as though on
solid ground'’; probably a bit of mis-taken etymology, for which see
above, on 19, 1. 29.

ut tum .· this ut is a mere repetition of ut before cum iussisset three
lines above. Ut is often thus repeated for clearness' sake, when the
clause with ut is broken up by the insertion of a new clause or clauses.
See good exx. in Acad. 2, 48 and 139, Fin. 3, 43, Verr. 2, 17 and 90,
also 4, 51, Liv. 5, 21, 1538, 6, 143 22, 11, 43 28, 9, 10.

non ut: very often a clause introduced by ut has depending on it
another clause with ut, as here and 22. The usage is inelegant, like the
similar repetition of the conjunction that in Eng. , and cannot be reckoned
to the credit of the Latin language. Exx. are Acad. 1, 24 and 45, also
2, 48, Fin. 3, 63 and 5, 24, Tusc. 1, 118.

dentinueretur: Caes. B. G. 7, 3 32 ne quid a'e iure aut de legibus eorum
deminuisse videretur. Trans. “not sor the purpose of weakening the
credit of our legal system''. Iure here=iure civili, the whole Roman
law, while in the next line it means a single legal principle.

21.
apud: “in the time of’'. ἓ

C. Furius etc. .· not. known exeepting from his law, which most
authorities refer to the year 183 Β. c. The purpose of the law was to keep
the property of families together by restricting testators from making
bequests of a larger amount than 1000 asses to any persons other than
the heres or heredes (who took upon themselves all the privileges and
