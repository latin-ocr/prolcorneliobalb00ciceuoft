when an adjective, by the dat.; so γνώριμος in Greek.

favour, praedicare and habere to proclaim and acknowledge it.

13 in dicendos=dicendi3 cf. Brut. 16 3 Scaevolae dicendi elegantia.

repeated with this ablative.

21 doctrinae dediti: the Stoics are meant, who were samed for holding
aloof from practical life, and who stated many paradoxes about the per-
fectly wise or moral man (sapiens, σοφὸς), as, for instance, that he alone
deserved the name of king, statesman, general, etc. Quasi quiddam
incredibile is a tentative translation of the term παράδοξον, which was
regularly applied to these Stoic opinions 3 cf. Cicero’s Paradoxa, passim.

22 omnis animo virtutes: the Stoics held that virtue was really one and
indivisible, and could not be possessed in part ; men were therefore
either wholly wise or wholly unwise, and the wise man (sapiens) must
ex vi termini possess all virtues. Notice the contrast between animo
and faceret ‚· the paradox lies in assuming that the man who has a
perfect intellectual apprehension of virtue (for the Stoics made virtue and
knowledge identical) is therefore of necessity perfect in practical affairs.
By comprehendere Cic. translates καταλαμβάνεσθαι, the word by which
the Stoics denoted the grasping of phenomena by the senses, and the
assent of the intellect to their truth.
