divisions, to make a very limited number of Roman citizens.
Marius received such a power under the agrarian law of
Saturninus¹. '

At the time of the civil wars appears the custom whereby
Roman commanders conferred the civitas on foreigners who
had aided the military operations. In theory the commanders
had no right to make such a gift without some such authorisa-
tion as that afforded to Pompeius by the lex Gellia Cornelia.

· · In practice, the formality of a law seems to have been osten

neglected. Marius enfranchised of his own motion, besides
scattered individuals2, two cohorts of allied troops (Plutarch
says 1000 men) who had fought bravely under him against the
Gau1s³. We know that his action was attacked as illegal, and
it is not recorded that even an ex postfacto authorisation was
given by the comitia. Cicero mentions in his speech for Balbus

six commanders (exclusive of Cn. Pompeius), Marius among ·

them, who had bestowed the citizenship on various personS, and
in no one instance does he mention that the proceeding was
founded on a statute. That his omission to mention the statute
cannot be explained by supposing him to have regarded it as a
matter of course, the facts about Marius (which must have been
within Cicero's own knowledge) clearly prove. It is probable
that Theophanes of Mitylene, the historiari of Pompeius’ wars,
was enfranchised by him without definite authority, and also some
other persons mentioned by Cicero as owing their enfranchise-
ment to Pompeius ⁴. When we put side by side with these facts
Cicero's statement that no one who had passed into the burgess
body by favour of a Roman general, had ever been ejected from

has not mentioned Balbus minor,

⁴ Ι conclude this from the fact
that nowhere in the Speech Pro
Balbo does Cicero mention the
name of Theophanes among those
enfranchised under the lex Gellia
Cornelia. In Pro Archia (ξ 24)
where Theophanes is mentioned,
Cicero's words point to the same
conclusion. It is singular that Cic.

received the civitas from Pompeius
(Plin. N. H. 5, 36). Had he re-
ceived it under the lex Gellia Cor-
nelia Cic. could scarcely have sailed
to mention him. Some of the in-
stances quoted in ξ 50 (cf. ex bello
Africano) must have occurred be-
fore that law was passed.
