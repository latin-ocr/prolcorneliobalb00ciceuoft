82 PRO BALBO. ν [ἓ 40—

ς 40, P. 36.

r testantur: ‘⁸ call as witnesses ’'.

Scipiones .· the two Africani3 Brutos: probably one man only is
meant, D. Iunius Brutus Gallaecus, consul in 138 and governor of His-
pania ulterior, who triumphed over the Gallaeci in 132, at the tim‘e
when Scipio triumphed over the Numantines ; cf. Arch. ‘²7- The
plural is used by a well-known idiom3 cf. Tusc. 1, 4 Pohtcletoe et
Parrhasios. '

Flaccos: the reading is doubtful3 see Appendix. Possibly the allu-
sion is to C. Valerius Flaccus, mentioned in § 55, who was consul in
93 13.C. and waged war against the Celtiberi.

Crassos: the reference no doubt is to Ρ. Licinius Crassus Dives,
the father of the triumvir, consul in 97, who was for several years
governor of fai-ther Spain. According to Strabo he sailed from
Gades to the Cassiterides and was the first Roman who visited those
islands.

4 Metellos: see on 5, 1. 26.

5 illorum .· put for suis, which might have been referred to Pompeius.

6 hoc tempore z'jhso .· the occurrences above alluded to were of compara·
tively old date ; while the scarcity of corn was great at Rome in 58 B.C.
and the years following, and led to the appointment of Pompeius as
praefectus annonae for five years with extraordinary powers. He had
authority to command all towns in the empire to send comto Rome at a
fixed price (Att. 4, 1, 7), and may have compelled the Gaditanes to send it.
From Cic.'s words, however (ut saepe ante), it seems that the corn sent
from Gades was a gift. Subject states anxious to cultivate the favour of
the Romans often made such gifts in time of scarcity (so Hiero in 215 B.c.;
see Liv. 22, 37, 6).

1 1 lzis gradibus ascensus: cf. Pro dom. 75 quibus tamquam gradibus in
coelum mihi videor ascendisse, Ein. 5, 40 multis gradibus ascendere, Har.

Resp. 43 aditus ad popularem iactationem atque ascensus, Leg. 3, 7 ad
honoris amplioris gradum ascensus.

§41.

η Afris etc-..¹ so 24, 1. 13.

¹3 multatis : “ mulcted in land and tribute”. Cic. seems to assume here
gibbauttgs not true, that no civitates foederatae had to cede land or pay ,.

1 5 nobzscum...impositas .· there is a slight zeugma, some words like ictum
esse being understood after nobiscum.

18 hospitium. publice fecisse .· i. e. they chose Balbus as their hospes
publicus, or patronus at Rome. Cf. Introd. p. 7, also Arch. Introd. p. 7.

20 tesseram: sc. hospitalem ; a token‚ or tally, broken into two pieces, one
of which was kept by each party ; identity could be proved by fitting the
two bits together. There is a scene in Plautus‘ Poenulus (5, 2, 87 sq.)
