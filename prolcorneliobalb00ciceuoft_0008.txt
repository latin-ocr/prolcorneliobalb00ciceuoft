deserves treatment more thorough than I have been
able to give it. The text being even now more
unsettled than that of any other speech of Cicer0,
Ihave given it my best attention in an Appendix.
In a few instances I have felt obliged to adopt
emendations of my own. The Latinity of the speech
has been treated with considerable minuteneSS‚ be-
cause the knowledge of Latin Prose expression is still
deficient when compared with the progress made in
other departments of pure scholarship by those for
whom the edition is especially constructed.

In dealing with a speech for which so little has
been done by scholars, Ι cannot hope to have escaped
from making errorS, though I trust not in matters
of moment.
