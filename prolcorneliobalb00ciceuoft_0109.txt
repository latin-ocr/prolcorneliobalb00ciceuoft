A PPENDIX ΟΝ THE T EX 7: 1 05

culm· father3 so Sest. 48 patria virtute praeditus filius. However
patrius and patemus are often almost interchangeable. Cf. Imp. Cn.
Pomp. 21 regnum patn'um atque avitum, with Sest. 57 regnum
pomum atque avitum.

527, 1. 13 quod: so C; Halm, ΒΚ quia, not an improvement.—
1. 19 mutari cz'vitate: so I have written for C mutare civitatem, and
below, 1. 2ο mutarifor· mutam—l. 21 civitatz‘s: Cobet civem ; the great ,
critic is in error, sor the repetition of the antecedent in the relative
clause is characteristic of Cicero. So Att. 2, 11, 1 dies enim nullus
erat, quo die, Or. 132 nullo modo animus audientis aut incitari aut
teneri potest qui modus a me non tentatus sit. A number of exx. are
collected by Ellendt De Or. 2, p. 78. Cf. the expressions below, l. 2 5
duarum civitatum esse and 1. 26 non esse huius civitatis, also 31, l. 193
51, 1. 17, Sest. 48. All these passages also condemn Orelli's addition
os civis after cimcatis.

ἓ 28, l. 25 civis noster: needlessly ejected by Pluygers; cf. 30, l. 26.
’·-1. ⁷30 videmus.- Madv. sor C vidimus, which would imply that Cic.
had personal acquaintance with the facts, which occurred before his
birth. Videmus-:audendo vel legendo cognovin1u53 cf. 55, l. 4.-cum :
inserted by Madv.; Halm ΒΚ nam. Madvig’s objection that, without
cum, potuissent ought to be poterant, is unfounded. Though usually ‘⁴ I
might have done this ” is represented by poteram or potui hocfacere, still
sometimes potuissem and possem are found, as in Off. 2, 14, Tusc. 1, ⁷84
and 88, Fam. 1, 9, 2 and 14.—l. 3 latum est ut.- C (except G2) om.
est; cf. Arch. p. 75.—l. 6 his: Halm ΒΚ suis, comparing 6, 1. 11 3 see
however my n.

ἓ 3ο, l. 23 Athenis: Pluygers Atheniensts‚ a mistake; :t was at
Athens that the enrolment of foreigners was commonest and there that
the Romans would be most likely to become acquainted with it.—l. 28
m‘si...recuperassent: ejected by Pluygers, who seems to think the prin-
ciple of postliminium did not apply to these cases3 see my n.—l. 5 ne
quem: E ut ne, which may be right.

ἓ 31, 1. 10 varietatem .· after this down to neve in 1. 11, P has a gap,
filled up by a later hand, probably from mere conjecture.—l. 19 ut...et :
Pl ut...ut (so BK); the rest et...et.—l. 20 generibus: so C; edd. after
Rumpf regionibus (comparing 30, l. 2). But genus and gens may well
be contrasted as class and a subdivision of a class.—l. 24 consecuti: C
,ςέἕίὴ which might be defended. In 38, 1. 19 C have servare, in 58, 1. 11

>non cessit.

5 32, l. 26 at enim: MSS et, which Madv. commendsz Cic. is how-
ever evidently answering an argument of his opponent.— Cenomanorum .·
P¹GE Genum horum, Ρ2 (so edd. before Madv.) Germanorum. No
treaty can have existed at the time between Rome and the Germans.
Moreover the other tribes mentioned lay close to Italy, and the Gauls
of Gallia transalpina, whom the Romans knew much better than
the Germans, are not specified by name.—l. 30 non est exceptum tbi:
C om.; added by edd.-l. 31 infhedere Gaditano exceptum .· C om. in
and exceptum. The former Ι have added, thinking it indispensable3 see
above, l. 28 and 33,1. 7. (Prepositions are notoriously easy to insert
md drop out). All edd. who insert exceptum put it after igilur ς 1 have
