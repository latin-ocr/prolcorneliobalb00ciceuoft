§ 27.
12 imperitissime: cf. 20, p. 28, 1. 1.

13 fundis .· a gerundive ought to follow, in agreement with fundis 3 the
omission is due to the fact that fieri (20, p. 28, l. 1) has no gerundive.

16 ‚tester iste magister: “this instructor of ours”; cf. 64, 1. 24 hoc
magistro. '

the individual in acquiring the franchise of another city, is strongly
maintained by Cic. in Caec. 9 5—100‚ a most important passage, which .
should be closely studied. Even the effect of the capitis deminutio
maxima (loss of status by being sold into slavery or by going into exile
to avoid punishment) was not necessarily permanent or final; freedom
might be recovered, or the sentence to which the exile was due might
be quashed, when the full rights of citizenship would at once be revived.
Cf. Pro Domo 77 cum hoc iuris a maioribus proditum sit, ut nemo civis
Romanus aut libertatem aut civitatem possit amittere nisi ipse auctor factus
sit3 ibid. ut civis Romanus libertatem nemo possit invitus amittere ς ib.
78 civitatem vero nemo umquam ullo populi iussu amittet invitus. Under
the empire the law was different ; persons condemned to penal servitude
(servitus poenae) or transportation (deportatio) lost the franchise.

28 Q. Maximo: Klotz says “die Sache ist ungewiss’', but no doubt the
man referred to is Q. F . Maximus Eburnus, praetor in 120, and consul
in 116 Β. C.‚ who about 105 stretched the old theory of the patria
potestas so sar as to put his disobedient son to death by his own hand,
with the assistance of two of his slaves. For this he was prosecuted by
the father of Cn. Pompeius Magnus, and condemned.
