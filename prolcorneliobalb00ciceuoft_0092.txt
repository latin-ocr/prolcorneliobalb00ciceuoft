It was one of the most important towns of Cisalpine Gaul. ff, as is

all civitates foederatae in Gallia Cispadana benefited by the lex Iulia of
90 B.C. and by the lex Plautia Papimkz of 89 B.C., it is not easy to
understand why Caesius had to depend on the favour of Pompeius sor
the citizenship. It is possible, but not likely, that Ravenna was one of
the towns which did not adopt the lex Iulia (cf. ἓ 21), and that Pompeius
enfranchised Caesius during the time between the passing of the first
