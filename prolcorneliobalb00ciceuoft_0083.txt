8 abest:=deest; so 9, 1. 30.
nusquam: used, as osten, where a modern would be inclined to use
ommquaqt. ·
9 causa dderz'or: a legal phrase3 “nor is the case of the Gaditanes

made thereby weaker'’. Cf. superiore causa below, 36, 1. 255 also 45,
1. 28 condicionibus civitatum atque causis.

12 per populum: not a populo, because in such matters the Senate
takes the initiative, and the people merely gives a formal authorisation.

17 nihil aliud: this statement is probably a very loose one, though
repeated in 38, 1. 17. It appears from Liv. 32, 2 that the original
treaty contained a stipulation binding the Romans not to send a prae·
fictus to govern the town.

pia et aeterna pax .· the usual formula in foedera was amicitia his legibus
esto (Liv. 38, 38, 2; cf. Polyb. 3, 22, 3 and 24, 4 ἐπὶ τοῖσδε φιλίαν εἶναι).
Pia pax is a formal peace concluded with due religious ceremonies3 cf.
ptum hastamque bellum (Liv. 42, 2 3, 6». For aeterna cf. Dionys. 6, 95

20 maiestatem...conservanto.· the insertion of this clause made the foedus
distinctly iniquum, for the clause bound the Gaditanes to defend Roman
interests, without binding Rome to defend those of Gades. The clause
recurs in slightly different words in the Aetolian treaty of 189 B.c. (Liv.
38, 11, 2) imperium maiestatemque populi Romani gens Aetolorum con-
servato sine dolo malo. Cf. Proculus in Dig. 49, 15, 7, 1 liber autem
populus est is qui nullius alterius populi potestati est subiectus sive qui
fhederatus est, item sive aequo foedere in amicitiamvem't sive foedere com-
prehensum est, ut is populus alterius populi maiestatem comiter conserva-
ret. The phrase comiter conservare is used by Liv. 42, 24, 10 with reser-
ence to the duties of hospitality.

21 ille: sc. populus Romanus. Cic. means: “does this clause infringe
{hi 1ταίςὲ <if 2Ιίιοῐῐιετ to grant the civitas to whom she pleases?” Cf. 38,
