PREFATORY NOTE.

THIS edition has been prepared on the same general
plan as that of the speech Pro Archia. The speech
sor Balbus, however, has been so generally neglected¹‚
and seems so little likely to be soon edited again,
that I felt it advisable to attempt to produce an
edition which would be worth the notice of mature
scholam, besides being useful to the undergraduates
and boys at public schOOIS, for whom it is primarily
designed. There seems to be in England a common
impression, which I hope this edition does not justify,
that it is impossible to produce editions of the
Classics which shall be at once useful to junior
students and to professe-d scholars². In Germany
opinion sets in the ssther direction, for many of the
editions designed for schools are also of the greatest
use sor advanced scholarS. This speech is so full of
matter illustrating the Roman modes of dealing
with the populations subject to their Empire, that it
¹ Neither Teuffel in his :j His· begu separately edited. ·
