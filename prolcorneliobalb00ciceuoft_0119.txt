“Mt Reid has decidedly attained his aim, namely, ‘a thorough examination os the
Latinity of the dialogue.’ . . . The revision of the text is most valuable, and comprehends
sundry acute corrections. . . . This volume, like Mr Reid’s other editions, is a solid gain

to the scholarship of the country.’'—A thenoeum.
“A more distinct gain to scholarship is Mr Reid's able and thorough edition of the

De Amicitia of Cicero, a work of which, whether we regard the exhaustive introduction
or the instructive and most suggestive commentat-y, it would be difficult to speak too
highly . . . . When we come to the commentar-y, we are only amazed by its sulness in
proportion to its bulk. Nothing is overlooked which can tend to enlarge the learner’s

“ Mr Reid has reviously edited the De Amicitia and the speeches Pro A rclzia and
Pro Balbo, and aff the commendation that we have had occasion to bestow upon his
previous efforts applies equally to this.''—Guardian.

“As the Cato Major is one of the most popular of its author‘s works, it is fortunate
that 1t should be included in the series of an interpreter who has done so much to
advance an intelligent and critical knowledge of Latinity in this country.'’—A thenaeum.
