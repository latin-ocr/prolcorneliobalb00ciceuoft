and in metaphorical applications Cic. uses the two words indifferently—
viz. Post Red. ad Qu. 13, Pis. 28, Pro domo 129, Sest. 33. Condi·
cionz'bus (for spelling see Arch. p. 73) “terms” offered to or imposed
upon one general by another ; here almost “legal status ''-

P. 26.

2 belli iure atque pacis: this is equivalent to “international law” as
understood by the Romans and superintended by the fetiales ; hence ius
fetiale (Off. 1, 36 and 3, 108, Liv. 1, 32, 5) has the same sense, but not
ius gentium, which has often been confounded with it, and has quite a
different scope (see Metine, Ancient Law, ch. 3). Cf. 45, p. 38, l. 3,
Liv. 5, 27, 6 sunt et belli sicut pacis iura, so 24, 33, 3.

nisi forte .· introduces, as usual, an objection presumed to be absurd.

3 umbra: osten used of the sedentary life as opposed to the life of
exertion; so Mur. 30 cedat forum castris, otium mimine, stilus gladio,
umbra soli; so the umbracula of scholars are contrasted with the sol and
pulvis of practical men in De Leg. 3, 14, Brut. 37; cf. also umbratilis·
vita, exercilatio, σκιαμαχεῖν, σκιαμαχία, Plat. Rep. 556 D πένης ἡλιωμένος
-πλούσιος ἐσκιατροφηκώς. Observe that the only proof Cic. offers of
Pompeius' familiarity with international law is the improbability that
he should be ignorant of it. Cf. ἓ 4 5.

4 litterae: a mere oratorical variation on libri above.
6 causa dicta est: so Arch. 8, p. 23, l. 33.

temporum etc. .· “ because I have regard more to the faults of our age
than to the nature of the trial”.

lzaec: not lzoc3 an attraction of the same sort as that above in 7 1. 17,
and below in 62, 1. 25. So Hor. Ep. 1, 1, 60 laic murus aheneus esto,
nil conscire sibi ; cf. Roby§ 1068.

8 virtuti invidere: so Hor. Od. 3, 24, 31 virtutem incolumem odimus .·
sublatum ex oculis quaerimus invidi. >

florem infringere: so Laberius (Ribbeck 115) florens cacumen nostrae
famae frangere.

9 abhinc annos: this accusative of time presents a difficulty, since it
seems used without any reference to duration. Yet it appears to be an
established fact that with abhinc the ablative‚ which one would expect,
is comparatively rare; though Mr Roby’s statement (ξ 1091) that it only
occurs twice in Latin (Verr. 2, 130, Plaut. Most. 2, 2, 63) is inexact.
The fact is the more remarkable, because such expressions as ante sex
annos sor annis, post quartum diem for quarto post die, are first found in
Livy (not Tacitus as Nipperdey on Ann. 1, 62 and Krebs-Allgayer s. v.
ante, incorrectly state—see Weissenborn on Liv. 31, 24, 6). The peculiar
usages post diem tertium eius diei and ante diem tertium are the only ex-
ceptions (Att. 3, 7, 1). The only explanation seems to be that there
is an idea of movement contained in the expression—“if P. going
back over a space of 500 years, had then lived''. With regard to the
