31 consultores: “clients'’, a lawyer being consultus. .

32* furium...Cascellium: not mentioned elsewhere except by Val. Max,
12, 8, 1 who merely quotes Cicero’s words here and Wrongly supposes the
men to be lawyers instead of brokers.

reiciebat: “referred'' ; cf. Att. 9, 13, 8 sed ne bis eadem legas ad {psam
te qistulam reicit).

33 Tugionem: apparently a lawyer who had specially studied the ius
aquae ducendae per alienum fundum and the ius aquae hauriendae ex
alieno fundo (briefly called by Cic. Caec. 74 aquae ductus, haustus),
which were part of the so-called servitutes (easeme’nts) praediorum rusti-
corum (see Dict. Ant.) and often caused disputes between neighbouring
propnetors.

P. 38. '

1 Aquilium: the most brilliant lawyer of his time, the subject ot an
ggitgavagant eulogy in Caec. 77———793 colleague of Cic. in the praetor-

2 de fhederibus: “when treaties are in question’'.

3 iure...belli: n. on 15, p. 26, 1. 2.

pmtissimis: substantival, as in 56, 1. 13 3 n. on Arch. 7, l. 3¹·

ἕω.

. 4 possumusne etc. .· “can we satisfy you by giving as authority sor a case

in point and for that course of action which you blame, the name of
C. Marius? Observe that Marius isalmost the only great democratic
leader of preceding times whom Cic. ever praises. Both Cic. and
Marius belonged to Arpinum, and there was a distant family con-
nexion between them.

6 quaeris: note the omission of the interrogative particle3 in positive
sentences the abruptness thus caused indicates some strong feeling, as of
surprise or indignation. Cf. 7, 1. 1-6.

8 is agitur: for readings in this section see AppendiX.

Iguvinatem: the people of Iguvium (an Umbrian town) are usually
called Iguvini. ·
to Camertium: the inhabitants of Camerinum (also in Umbria and not
to be confounded with Cameria in Latium) were called Camertes. After
the word Camertinum the word spedus must be supplied. The foedus
between Camerinum and Rome was probably as old as 310 B.C. (Liv.
9, 36, 7). Livy in 28, 45, zo calls it aequum and it would appear from
the passage that Camerinum was not even bound by treaty to supply
Rome with troops (cf. Val. Max. 6, 5, 1). The fhedus with Iguvium
is known only from this passage, but was probably concluded in 308 Β. c.
at the same tune with that between Rome and Ocriculum, another Um-
brian town (Liv. 9, 41, πο).
