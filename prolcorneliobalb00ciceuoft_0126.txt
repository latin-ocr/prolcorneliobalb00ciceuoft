“It zs dzfficult to commend too highly this excellent series.—Guardian.

“The modesty of the general title of this series has, we believe, led
many to misunderstand its character ana' underrate its value. The books

are well suited fhr study in the upper forms os our best schools, but not
the less are they adapted to the wants qs all Bible students who are not

specz'alz‘sts. We doubt, indeed, whether any of the numerous popular
commentaria recently z'ssued in this country will be found more scr-
viceablefor general use.‘'—Academy.
