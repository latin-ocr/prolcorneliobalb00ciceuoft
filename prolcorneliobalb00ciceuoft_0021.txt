JNTRODUCTION ¹7

whose relations with the Roman government were regulated by

'¹ a definite compact; (b) those over whom the Romans exercised

an authority not restricted by any treaty obligations. The latter
class was properly denoted by the phrase peregm‘ni dediticii,
and may be at once dismissed as not concerning us here. For
the other class the most general term is socii. The privileges
possessed by the allied communities were most diverse, depend-
ing entirely on the provisions of the treaties concluded when
they first carne under the influence of Rome. The Latini were
· merely a specially privileged class of socii, but the phrase
foederati populi was generally used so as to exclude the Latini,
though Cicero in the present speech, using it in the strict sense,
makes it include the socii Latini nominis ¹.
Ι ⁷ The Romans broadly distinguished foedera2 as favourable
and unfavourable (aequa and iniqua), but the terms are incapa-
ble of accurate definition. If the obligations undertaken by
Rome were as great as, or greater than, those undertaken by the
allied state, the treaty was regarded as favourable. 1f the corn-
pact contained clauses humiliating in any way to the civitas
foederata, the foedus was iniquum. The treaty with Gades was
distinctly an iniquum foedus, for its first clause was humiliating
to the Gaditanes³. If the treaty contained stipulations for the
permanent payment of tribute to Rome, in money or kind, the
tributary state was stipendiaria, and its inhabitants stzpendz'arii.
These terms, however, are loosely used, and Cicero speaks sorne-
times as though a state which was foederata could not be
stipendiaria 4.

All populations not directly governed from Rome, but pos—
sessing governments of their own, partly independent of Roman
control, and laws of their own, were in a sense libert-⁶. But the
terms liberi populi, liberae civitates were, at the end of the
Republic, particularly applied to those communities which had
no abiding connexion with Rome—for example the Cenomani
and Helvetii mentioned in this speech⁵.
