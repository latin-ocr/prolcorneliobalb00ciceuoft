JNTROD UCTJON. 9

was merely mocking him (so he puts it) in asking him to step in
· between' the combatants1, yet he says that the letters and con-
versation of Balbus really kept him from seeing until it was too
late that it was his duty openly to side with Pompeius2.

When the Pompeian party had abandoned Italy to Caesar,
Balbus did his best to obtain further honours by the aid of his
powerful patron. He coveted a seat in the Senate‚ and pro-
bably obtained it at this time. Cicero calls it a monstrosity
that an alien born should think of becoming a Roman senator3.
’ During the dictatorship, Balbus and Oppius were Caesar's
agents, with carte blanche to act for him in all his concerns43
Caesar also took counsel with Balbus on his most important
public affairs⁶. After Cicero returned to Rome, at the end of
the Alexandrine war, he was obliged to go to Balbus as a suitor
for Caesar's good-will. A bitter trial it must have been for the
great orator to ask favours os the Gaditane, now become “one
of the tyrants⁶’'. Yet Balbus remained on friendly terms with
Cicero till the death of the latter. When Caesar was murdered,
Balbus left Rome. From the first public appearance of Octa-
vianus he gave that commander his support7. In 43 or 42 he
became praetor, and in 40 gained the consulship, being the first
man of alien birth who attained that honourss. The date of
Balbus' death is not known. He left by his will a legacy of 25
denarii to every citizen of Rome9. The eighth book of the
bellum Gallicum is dedicated to him, and he left behind him a
diary containing memorials of his own life and that of Caesar10.

At the time of his recall from exile (57 Rc.) Cicero had
taken especial pains to stand well with all the members of the
first triumvirate—Caesar‚ Pompeius and Crassus. The first of
