74 PRO BALBO. [g 30...-

24 ascribi: so Arch. 8, p. 24, 1. 7, and 10, p. 24, 1. ²9· Archias was
a citizen of many Greek cities.

quo errore: strictly incorrect‚ since the Greeks were justified in be-
longing to many cities 3=errore ex ea re nato.

26 iudicum: ie. δικαστῶν, or ἡλιαστῶν, of whom at Athens there were
6000, chosen 600 from each tribe, hence certa tribu. There were 10
courts (δικαστήρια) and jurors were assigned to each by lot. Every juror
employed received a ticket (πινάκιον) inscribed with his name and, to de-
note the court in which he was to serve, a letter, to which Cic. refers in
the words certo numero (letters being used to denote numbers). As the,
Areopagus had no fixed number of members, but consisted of the past
archons, and was not divided into sectional courts, the words certa tribu,
certo numero can only apply to iudicum.

28 postliminio: Cic. seems to imply that the principle of postliminium
applied to those Romans who after becoming citizens of other towns
returned to Rome, as well as to those Romans who had been in captivity.

29 nemo...dicavit: thus in spite of his close connexion with Athens,
Atticus refused to be enrolled there as a citizen3 see Nepos Att. 3} 1.¹

Agoris (ἐς liuris .· so more lege iure (Rosc. Am. 143), neque more neque iure
( uet. u . 18).

30 in aliam se dicavit: but in 28, 1. 26 the dative follows se dicare3
there are many verbs which Cic. sometimes uses with dat. sometimes
with in (or other preposition) and acc.; e.g. adhaerere, convenire, illu-
dere, imminere, also addere, adicere, subicere, offerre, obicere (Arch. 14, 1.
15, n.).

P. 32.

1 religionis ac foederum : n. on 15, p. 25, 1. 3 3 3 cf, Vert. 5, 49 relzgioni-
bus foederum.

2 deflendo, etc. .· “ I maintain the general proposition that, etc.”

ex omni regione: these words are almost equivalent to an attribute of
gentem. strictly speaking, ortam or some such word is omitted in such
expressions ; so Liv. 4, 28, 3 Vettus Messius ex Volscis, and often. For
ex a. modern would write in ; cf. ol αὐτόθεν “those on the spot ”3- also 32,
l. 26 non nullorum ex Gallia barbarorum. Omni here is put loosely sor
ulla 3 so sine omni is common in colloquial language for sine ullo or aliquo.
Regione terrarum: “ quarter of the world'’ 3 n. on Arch. 23, l. 31.

3 tam (insidentem-:quae tanto opere dissideat3 cf. Kennedy, Gram.
ἓ 238 Β. 1. Beware of taking esse dissidentem together, as though the
participle were here a mere predicate or epithet, used like an adjective.

4 discidio: most scholars now hold with Madvig (Excursus to De Fin.)
that wherever dissidium occurs it is a mere MSS corruption for dmidium.

5 coniunctam .· a slight zeugma, cum ea having to be supplied from a
populo Romano above.

interdictum sit...possimzcs: as the clause with ne depends on a verb
in the perf. tense, possemus might have been expected3 the present.
