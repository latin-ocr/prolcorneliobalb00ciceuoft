prosecutor’s view of the fact, and not the fact itself, is indicated. Pom-
peius came to Spain in 76, owing to the ill success of Q. Metellus Pius,
and yet for some time had himself just as little good fortune. The war
was indeed durissimum for the Romans.

31 Sucronensi et Dtm’msi: Sucro, a river some distance S. of Saguntum,
with a town called Sucro at its mouth, where a very great but indecisive
battle was fought in 75 B.c. between Pompeius and Sertorius. This
was the battle at which Sertorius declared he should have thrashed the
boy (Pompeius) had not the old woman (Metellus) come up. Turia is a
river lying about half-way between the Sucro and Saguntum, with the
town of Valentia at its mouth. Here a great battle was fought between
the combined forces of Metellus and Pompeius, and those of Sertorius
(Plutarch, Sertor. 19).
