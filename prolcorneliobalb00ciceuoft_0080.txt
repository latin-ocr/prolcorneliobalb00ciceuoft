fhedera .· the clause in these treaties to which Cic. refers was most likely
not demanded by the Romans, but by the tribes themselves, who wished
to protect their nationality. The fhedus of the Cenomani was probably
somewhat older than 187 Β. C. (Liv. 39, 3). After remaining faithful
(alone among the Gauls) to the Romans while Hannibal was in Italy,
they joined Hamilcar against Rome, but deserted at the battle< of
Comum (197 B.C.; cf. Liv. 32, 30) and remained quiet ever aster.
The Insubrians were defeated in the same battle, and took up arms
no more. The Helvetii first appear in history as allies of the Cimbri
and Teutones in the time of Marius, and were finally beaten by Caesar
in 58 B.C. The Iapides were a turbulent Illyrian people, only finally
subdued by Augustus. It should be noted that some of the eommuni-
ties here referred to were in 89 Rc. placed in the position of Latin
colonies and in 49 Β. C. received from Caesar the full franchise.

28 Gallia: here only includes G. transalpina.

barbarorum .· inserted because Rome had fhedera with states in Gaul,
such as Massilia, not inhabited by barbari.
