praediatorio: persons bound to perform duties to the state, the non-
performance of which would cause pecuniary loss to the state, v'vere
required to produce sureties (praedes) who would be liable in person and
property (praedia) should the duties not be performed· The praes agreed
in a formal document that stated portions of his property should in that
case be liable to distraint. The technical phrase sor the whole proceed-
ing was praedibus ac praediis populo cavere (Liv. 22, 60, 4) and the praes
was said subsignare praedia (Flacc. 80). If distraint became necessary
the officials of the aerarium sold the specified property after public
advertisement (proscriptio), and there was a class of mercantile specu·
lators called praediatores who bought up such property (Gaius 2, 61
qui mercatur a populo praediator vocatur). The legal rules relating to
such distraint were -called ius praediatorium (Cic. Att. 12, 17) and
were contained in a particular chapter of the edictum praetorium headed
de praediatoribus. ' ⁴ -
