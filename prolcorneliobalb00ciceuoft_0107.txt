58. 1. 24 ait.- G¹E agit, which may very possibly 3be right, i. e.
“what line· does the prosecutor take?” Cf. Cluent. 52 sin autem illud
egeram, nullum ad Scamandrum morte Habiti venturum emolumentum
ficit-se, also Pro dom. 34. —l. 29 cuncter.- aster this in P several lines
were left blank and filled in by a later hand. The addition (found with
variations in GE) is pure conjecture, and being improbable, is not
worth discussion.

59. 1. 30 adesset: C abesset, a very common variant. -1.4 cui.- so
Madv. sor mquid; first cui was written quid, then in addedf M. also
struck out eius before consiltorum. —l. 8 quem.- Halm needlessly quo
quem. —l. 9 ultimae gentes: so edd for C ultra regentes, P with a gap
between t and r of ultra, which seems to point to ulteriores, rather than
ultimas.

ἕ ιο. 1. 15 vero-⁴ C verum, as though imperia were dependent on
postulanti. —l. 19 populo Romano: C rezpj, the contraction p.r. having
been inverted to r p cf. 5, 1. 16; 20, p. 28, 1. 4. —nonnes Orelli

5 11. 1. 21 diceret: 1³1 dicere, t is very frequently omitted and
inserted3 so 1111.28 PG have dubztasset3 ib. esse is in C; 14,1. 25 GE
επις 2ο, p. 28, 1. 7Ρ1 resedzsse3 38, l. 11 PG1E dicere.

ἕ 12. l. 33 vixtsset: aster this C insert et, which is very often
omitted and inserted after verb· forms ending in ·et; here dzlxzsset et con-
tributed to the mistake. So in 11, l. 26 C om. et3 in 24,1. 13 GE
have nam et; 1114,8 1. 31 Ρι has donasset et. —l. 2 Graeci: C cum
Graeci, altered by Madvig. —L 3 relig otone.. ,veritata- P1 relzjgionem
vm‘tatem3 this final m is lightly dropt and added. So in 17,1.2ῐ
C relinquam. —constrictam.· written over the line m P² and so may not
be the word Cic. wrote3 Halm suggests vinctam, comparing Font. 2ο.

ἕ 14, l. 21 levioris: so 1 have written for C levzus; cf. n. on 54, l. 24
(iudt'cr'orum for iudicum). Madv. remarked that levius c'ould neither mean

“a more venial offence'ss nor ‘a thing shewing a more worthless
character”‚ which latter sense would require levium hominum. This
is just the meaning given by levioris. Madv. indeed says, ‘nec levi·
tatis est facere quod scias non ltcere’', but surely any one who is not
gravate may be called levis. Lambinus read non levzus, which Madvig
commenda m spite of the fact that it leaves most of the objections to
levius untouched. Bait. peius. -1. 22 quam: edd. for C an, which is

uite out of place m a comparison. -l. 23 non scire.- see my n. Halm
111 Addenda to Orelli ed. 2) says Ρ2 has non scire on an erasure, this
he thinks makes the reading very doubtful. -1. 25 cum ius: Madv. sor
cuiun a word which often gives trouble. Thus GE have cui for cuius
in 16,1. 123 17, l. 273 so E in 29,1.21; cf. zus for limus which C
have 11142,1. 29. Possibly here qui ius is what Cic. wrote—l. 28
praediti mi’litari: Orelli militari praediti. It was once the fashion for
scholars to change the order of the words for the merest fancy. Thus
Orelli has, against C, 15 ,.l 8 labes atque macula3 26, 1. 5 praemus-
