ORATIO. *Edited for Schoolsqand Colleges. Extra⁴ fbp. 38. 6d.

“Mr Reid is so well known to scholars as a commentat on Cicero that a new
work from him scarcely needs any commendation of ours. Hi dition of the speech Pro
Sulla is sully equal in merit to the volumes which he has already published . . . . 1t
would be difficult to speak too highly of the notes. There could be no better way of
gaining an insight into the characteristics of Cicero¹s style and the Lati'nity of his period .
than by making a caresul study of this speech with the aid of Mr Reid's commen . . .
Μι- Reid’s intimate knowledge of the minutest details of scholarship enables him memet
and explain the slightest points of distinction between the usages of different authors and
different periods . . . . The notes are followed by a valuable ap ndix on the text, and
another on points of orthography ς an excellent index brings t e work to a close.”—

S atu rday R evz'ew.

“Mr Reid’s wide and prosound knowledge of his author's diction renders hima
particularly sure guide to his meaning, and no intelligent student can read one bf his
works without a material strengthening of his scholarship . . . . It is not too >much to say
that the style of Mr Reid's commentaries is now approaching perfection.”—Athenaeum.

“There is plenty of help for the tiras but there are few* indeed among advanced
Ciceronian scholars who will not feel that there is many a crumb for them, too, scattered
here and there in his instructive notes. The confidence with which Cicero's usa e is
laid down, even upon comparatively trifling points, is warranted by the store ο apt '
references always ready to bear out the rule . . . . On the whole it is impossible to
desire a book more completely τετράγωνος, ἄνευ ψόγου τετυγμένος.”-Ασαιίεηι,γ.
