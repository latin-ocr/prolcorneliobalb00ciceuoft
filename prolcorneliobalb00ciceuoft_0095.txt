πο cunt praesentem .· “and that though ”3 cf. n. on Arch. 19, l. υ.

21 nomen: i.e· repetundarum, the mere sound of which, Cic. implies,
was hateful to the Senate.

22 calamitate: n. on 28, l. 27. The statement contained in the clause
is not strictly correct, sor the Servilian law subjected to the jurisdiction
of the quaes-tio repetundarum not merely senators (among whom all the
magistrates from quaestors upwards were included) but others not neces·
sarily members of the Senate‚ viz. sons of senators, the tresviri agris
dandis, the tresviri capitales, and the tm'buni militum quattuor primarum
legionum.

23 dubitandum ficit etc..· ‘⁴ was it (viz. at the time referred to) a doubt-
ful point that in a matter where the boon won in the courts was allowed
validity, in the same matter the decisions os generals were of authority?”
That is, “it is clear that those statesmen who thought prosecution a
legitimate mode of winning the citizenship, must have equally admitted
the validity of the franchise when conferred by commanders ”. For the
reading iudia’orum see Appendix; the reader must be caresul to make
the geu. depend on praemia not on genere, which is herclest, as is fre·

ff quently the case in Cic. ‚ without a defining genitive3 rerum, or causarum,
or some word of equally unrestrict'ed import‚ must here be supplied, the

26 ceteri&- the context. compared with ἓ 21, shews that laws opening the
civitas to individual Latini are meant (hence the insertion of hominibus as

opposed to populos).

30 religione.- here subjective3 “ religious fieling” as opposed to external
worship (caerimonia); so Verr. 4, 84 Mercurium qui sacris anniversariis
ac summa religione coleretur.

3¹ de Graecia: according to Dionysius (6, 17) the worship of Demeter
was established at Rome in 496 Β. c. at a time of famine. ’

. per Graaeas curata.- observe that per does not introduce the agent
aster the passive verb; after curata supply a populo Romano, the
priestesses being only instruments; cf. 37, 1. 7, n.

3² ν Graeca omm'a nontinata .· “ all the terms used are Greek ’'. Nominare
omnia Graaea=nullum verbum nisi Graecum usurpare. So Fin. 3, 5
Stoici plurima nominaverunt, “the Stoics have invented many technical
termls ’, whelrle Madvig's reading navaverunt does not suit the context
