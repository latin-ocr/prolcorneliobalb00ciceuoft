osten almost equivalent ternis, as in Verr. 4, 149 legum sanctionem poenam-
que. The Romans distinguished between poena divina and poena humana
(cf. Leg. 2, 22); a sanctzo might decree either or both. If it decreed the
former at au, the foedus or lex might properly have applied to it the
term sacrosanctus. If the poena humana was omitted (as was necessarily
the case with a foedus—cf. Liv. 1, 24-and as happened with some leges
relating to res divinae) the enactment would be genere ipso poenae sacro-
sanctum, i.e. merely (note the force of ῥύεο) by virtue of the class of
punishment decreed. But most leges sacrosanctae contained not only an
obtestatio (invocation of the gods to punish the offender) but a consecratio
captus, which brought with it human punishment.

9 sanctiones sacrandae sunt etc. .· many scholars have unjustly suspected
this phrase, because such an expression as sacrare sanctionem does not
occur elsewhere. But 'sanctio is a portion of a lex and sacrare legem is
at least implied in the name lex sacrata. Trans. ‘⁶ penal clauses must be
placed under divine sanction ’'. The change of construction from genere
poenae to cum (when) consecratur is noticeable. For obtestatione legzls (an
invocation to the gods contained in a law) cf. Pro domo 125 obtestatio tibi-
cinis (an invocation made by a tibicen), also Arch. 31, 1. 17 beneficio legzs,
where see n.

12 dicere: the infin. as object aster habeo is common in Cic. (as N. D. 3,
93 dicere, Att. 2, 22, 6 scribere) but rare in other prose writers, though
found in poets of all epochs. · “

13 utmm...confirmas: this clause has been wrongly ejected by many
scholars, including Madvig. Cic.'s question is: ‘⁴ Can you point out any
ἐξ 2315& αἱ), pthis so-called foedus, and containing either the obtestatio or

15 populum: the comitia centuriata ; plebem .· the comitia tributa, which
usually conferred on the Senate the power to conclude foedera.

17 id...ratum .· Cic. is quoting the old proviso of the XII tables given in
Liv. 7, 17 ut quodcumque postremum populus iusszkset, id ius ratumque
essa. Every law, or nearly every law contained a proviso (sanctio)
Xde 'impunit31te si quid contra alias leges· eius legzs ergofactum sit'' (Cic.

tt. 3, 23, 2 . Α -

18 illis verbis: ‘⁸ the well-known clause ”3 Cic. refers to a standing clause
in all laws, thus given by Valerius Probus (qu. by Rein in Pauly's
Realenc. art. lex) si quid sacri sanctique est, quod ius non sit rog-amer,
eius hac lege nihilum rogatur3 cf. Caec. 96, Pro dom. 106. Either the
terms of the clause were not uniform, or Cic. (as is osten the case with him)
quotes them inaccurately.

2 3 opinionem : ‘⁸ judgment ’'-
24 auctoritatem senatus .· strictly speaking auct. senatus is a resolution of
the Senate which lacks some formality (such as the assent of the tribunes)

to give it force; when all the formalities are completed it becomes a
senatus consultum.
