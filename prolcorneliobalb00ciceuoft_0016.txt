12 INTRODUCTJOM

therefore was necessary whether whole communities or indi-
viduals were enfranchised. The ensi-anchisement of communities
does not much concern the case of Balbus, but it is advisable
to consider the chief instances of individual enfranchisement·
which occur in the Republican history of Rome.

It was a truly fatal blunder which the Roman government
committed during nearly the whole of the Republican period, in
allowing the burgess body to be freely recruited from the slave
population of the city, by manumission, while the doors of· the
constitution were almost entirely shut against foreigners of rank
and respectability. This policy contributed more than anything
else to the degradation of the comitia. To aliens of position
and character the franchise was doled out by driblets, while
slaves swept from all quarters of the world, and debased by
generations of servitude, passed into the burgess body in a never-
ceasing stream.

The first recorded instance of the enfranchisernent of an in-
dividual by special act is that of L. Mamilius, dictator of Tus-
culum, who had rendered service to Rome (458 B.C.)². Similar
instances must have occurred, the memory of which has been
lost; there are many persons whom we know to have received
the citizenship though the time and manner of its bestowal are
unrecorded. The next case of which we hear is that of the
Campanian Knights, who became citizens by vote of the comitia
when Capua revolted in 215 B.C.2. In 211 Sosis a Syracusan,
and Moericus a Spaniard³‚ and in 210 Muttines a Carthaginian
were awarded the cz‘vz‘las for their services4. In 186 Fecennia
Hispala, a freedwoman, received the rights of an ingenua on
account of the information she gave concerning the Bacchana-
lian excesses of that year⁵. In the speech for Balbusss, Cicero
mentions an act for giving the franchise to a Greek priestess
of Ceres, born at Velia, and intimates that it was only one of
a number of similar enactments.

There was an old and sornewhat loose practice of allowing
the commissioners for carrying out colonisation or agrarian {and
