APPENDIX ΟΝ THE TEXI: 101

11, 1. 23; arcium in 15, 1. 3o; provintiis in 24,1. 143 spetiem in 39, 1.
293 Camere-ium 11146, 1. 103 pertinatiam in 62, l. 26: Mutia in 54, l. 20;
pronunciatum in 11, l. 30. MSS have nuntium in 64, 1. 13, which is
right, the stem being originally novent· (nov- in novus).

Voltis: so P rightly in 13, l. 63 ΒΚ vultis3 cf. voltu in 58, l. 14.

Litteris, not liten’s (in 3, l. 20) ; cf. Corssen‚ Ausspr. 1, 176, ed. 2.

Opsessum: so Madv. in 5, 1. 30 (see crit. n.); in 6, 1. 13 P has
opsessiom’s, in 18, p. 27, l. 4 optinere, in 16, l. 20 optrectatorum.

Rettulisset (11, l. 27) P; retulisset GE; and in 32, p. 33, 1. 5 reppule-
runt, in PG. Rettuli, reperi, repuli are without authority3 see Neue,
Form. 2, 2.

Adulesgntulo: so PK rightly in 16, l. 103 Β has adol. In 63, p. 45.
l. 1 P has adulescens.

Intellego: so PGK in 18, p. 27, 1. 11; Β wrongly intellego. In 27,
1. 14 P has intellegi, and in 63, p. 45, 1. 8 intellego.

Comminus: so PGBK in 23, p. 29, l. 4. There is plenty of evidence
in fagour of this form, which Orelli alters here to cominus. See Neue,
2, 5 .

⁷Cottidie: PGK cotidie in 43, l. 13 where B has quotidie.

Urguetur: P¹ in 59, l. 26, and it may have been written by Cic.;
the'Mss of Vergil give the form urgueo almost always.

Gerendus: so ΕΚ 111 4, l. 10, but PGB gerundus. The latter form
of the gerundive was probably only used by Cic. in legal and other
arehaic phrases.

Saaeuli: so PBK rightly: Orelli seculi. The evidence is collected in
Fleckeisen, Fiinfzig Artikel, p. 27.

Heracliensium in 21, l. 16. Cf. Arch. p. 73.

Iapidum: so C in 32, l. 273 ΒΚ wrongly Iapydum. Cic. is not
likely to have looked on the word as Greek, and the third vowel as Greek
υς therefore heis not likely to have written the y. The spelling Sylla
for Sulla is wrong for the same reason, though given by C in 64. 1. 20.

Offuerint: C rightly in 63, p. 45, l. 83 ΒΚ obfuerint. The com-
bination bf was generally avoided by Cic.

c. C ritical notes.

ἕ 1, l. 1 valent: so Ernesti for valerent, the confusion being of a sort
extremely common—1. 7 voluntati paris.- edd. for voluntatis parens.
The addition of s is very frequent, ag. in 7, 1. 18 PG have actiones,
in Arch. 26 MSS gratis for Grati. The confusion of e with iis constant;
50 P1 has accusatores in 7, l. 18 and decente in 11, 1. ''³z4. For the addi-
tion of n after a vowel see n. on 2, 1. 11 potuerim—l. 8 alio loco .· Halm
removes the stop and adds dicturus, but he is assuredly wrong3 588 my n.
—l.h 9 hoc pono: C oppono, from the dropping of li and coalescence of oc
wit pono.

δα, 1. 10 referenda: C adferenda, prepositions in compound verbs
being often capriciously interchanged.—l. 1 ι potuerim: G¹ potuerit, E
potuerint. N is inserted and omitted with great variation in MSS3 so P
has videbantur in 1. 15, agerent in 3, p. 22, 1. 2, liceant in 26, l. 2, fiterit
in 40, l. 9. PG¹E have sint in 40, l. 93 C have fuerit in 4, l. 14 ; PG1
