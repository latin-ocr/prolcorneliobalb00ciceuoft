Q. Metellus: i. e. Numidicus, cons. 109 13. c., who> conducted the
war against Iugurtha. The trial referred to (for misappropriation of
public moneys) probably took place after he had governed a province
asf pro-praetor, but some authorities place it after his return from

2 1 repetundis .· the form of the gerundive in undus was archaic in Cic.’s
time, and occurred chiefly in those legal and religious forms where old
modes of writing linger longest. In this particular word the u seems
to have been retained in later times also (Neue, Formenlehre 2, 458).
Cf. Appendix, n. on 4, l. 18 gerendus.

22 patriae salus.- in 100 Β. c. the demagogue Saturninus passed by
illegal violence an agrarian law which contained a proviso that the
Senate should within five days swear obedience to its provisions.
Metellus alone refused the oath, and when Saturninus brought forward
a law to drive him into exile, voluntarily withdrew, rather than risk
disturbances in the city. Cic. is never weary of praising Metellus
for his patriotism, and constantly calls attention to the similarity of
the circumstances attending his own exile. Cf. Sest. 101 de civitate
maluit quam de sententia demoveri, Pis. 20 ne armis confligeret ceden-
dum esse duxit, Post Red. in Sen. 38 cum vim caedemque fugisset.

2 3 igitur: used here like Eng. “then’' or “well'' to resume the narrative,
broken by the interposition os the words from ille to maluit. This usage
is exceedingly common ln C1e.‚ who also thus uses erge, autem and sed.

crime being generally indicated (as here and Cluent. 1473 cf. below, 48,

l. 31) by an abl. with de, but sometimes by a genitive, as capitis (Quint.9 5).
ipsius: n. on 6, p. 23, 1. 5 3 ‘eius here would have been less emphatic.

tabulae: “accounts’' for public money-disbursed by him during his
provincial governorship.

circumferrentur: “were being handed round'’; so in Att. ι, 16, 4 and
Verr. 2, 104 cedo, quaeso, codicem ,· circumfer, ostende.

inspiciendi nominis .· the word inspicere is a vox propria in connexion
with the official examination of accounts3 e. g. Verr. 3, 171 posco rationes.-
inspicio litteras, so Liv. 6, 27, 8, Plin. Ep. 10, 48, 1. Nominis:
some particular entry3 nomen properly means the name, at the head of
a page in a ledger, of a person with whom business has been done;
it often means a debt, sometimes a debtor.

25 equitibus: from the time of C. Gracchus to that of Sulla, with very
slight intervals, the iudicia were in the hands of the equites (Verr. Act.
Prim. 38 cum equester ordo iudicaret annos prope L continuos).

26 neminem: notice the force the word acquires by its separation·from
iudicem. Cic. might have written here qui non for quin3 it seems im-
possible to discover any rule for the use of these expressions.
