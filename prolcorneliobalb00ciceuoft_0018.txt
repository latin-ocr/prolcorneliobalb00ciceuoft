it by judgment of a court1‚ we see that the position of Balbus,
primasacz'e, was particularly strong.

Ι have already sketched generally, in the Introduction to the
speech for Archias2‚ the position held by the alien act of Papius
(on which this indictment was founded) among similar Roman
statutes‚ and have also indicated the kind of procedure adopted
under it. Ι only need add here that the lex Papia was proba-
bly passed chiefly for the purpose of weakening Caesar and the
democrats‚ and to drive from Rome their numerous foreign
supporters (particularly the transpadane Gauls), who swelled the
ranks of the infima plebs or city rabble.

Along with Cicero Pompeius and Crassus spoke for the
defence. Cicero says of ' the speech of Crassus that it was able
and accurate3. We have a description by Cicero of the oratory
of Crassus ⁴. His abilities were narrow, his education narrower,
but the interest he took in his cases, and the toil and labouraehe
spent upon them, made him for many years one of the first ad-
vocates at Rome. His language was pure and dignified, his
arrangement careful, but he used none of the flowers or orna-
ments of speech. His tone was earnest, but his delivery
monotonous. The speech of Pompeius contained a glowing eulogy
of Cicer05. This accounts partly for the extravagant praise
which Cicero bestows on its learning and adornments⁶. Pom-
peius did not rank very high among the speakers of his day.
Cicero in the “Brutus''⁷ merely says of him that he might have
attained higher excellence as an orator had not his ambition led
him into other paths; that there was breadth in his treatment
of cases; that he was skilled in clearly seeing the issues; that
his voice was brilliant and his gesture dignified. It is interesting
to observe that when Cicero was engaged in a defence with
other advocates, he always spoke last by common consent8.
This was due, he says himself, to his power of making a pathetic

and moving appeal to a jury9. We know that in defending
