‘Caesar's staff in Gau11. Balbus had his hands constantly full of
Caesar's business. In 54 Β. C. he made two journeys between
Rome and Gaul2. About this time the friendly feeling between
Cicero and Caesar was greater than it had ever been, and it was
probably in this year that Caesar lent the orator a large sum of
money, which remained unpaid for many years, and caused the
borrower much trouble³. With this business Balbus was mixed
up4. When matters began to drift towards civil war Balbus
frequently appeared on the scene as Caesar's agent. In 51 he
was at Rome and expostulated with Scipio, Pompeius' father-in-
law, who had broached a proposal for depriving Caesar of his
command in Gaul5. Again in 50 Balbus was negotiating
with Pompeius and Scipio on behalf of Caesar⁶. In the same
year he tried to remove the dissensions between the tribune
Curio and the consuls, which had prevented the supplicatio in
honour of Cicero's military achievements in Cilicia from being
carried out, though actually decreed by the Senate⁷. At the end
of 50, when war had become inevitable, Balbus wrote “blandas
litteras’' to Cicero, in the hope of securing him for Caesar's side8.
When the war actually broke out Balbus left Caesar’s camp for

there than in the army, partly from a reluctance to fight against
his patron Pompeius and the other consul of the year, a Lentulus,
to whom also he was indebted9. At Rome Balbus looked after
the private interests of Lentulus as well as those of Caesar, and
pursued his old policy of standing well with all parties. At
this time he wrote frequent letters to Cicero, urging him to make
peace between Caesar and Pompeius, more with the view* of
preventing Cicero from joining Pompeius than in the expecta-
tion that any aetion in favour of peace would be possible. Some
of these letters have been preserved. Cicero felt that Balbus
