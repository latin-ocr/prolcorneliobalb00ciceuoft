96 PRO BALBO. [gbl—e

9 optenta: in spite of the traditional objection to translating obtineo by
“ obtain’'‚ it will be seen that this passage admits and almost requires
such a rendering.

dolorem —luctum—maerorem .· dolor is grief as felt at the beart, luctus
as expressed by material signs, in the dress, for instance, maeror as
expressed by the condition or action of the sufferet, for example, by the
gloom on his countenance. The following is a striking passage—Art.
12, 28, 2 maerorem minui, dolorem nec potui nec si possem, vellem. ’

11 genere...numero: the thanksgiving for victories lasted, no doubt, ori·
ginally, only one day3 three days then became usual 3 for Marius ten
were decreed3 sor Pompeius after the Mithridatio war twelve (Prov.
Cons. 26); for Caesar after conquering the Helvetii, and the union of
nearly all the German and Gaulish tribes in ,58 and 57 B. c. fifteen days
(quod ante id tempus accidit nulli, as he himself says, B. G. 2, 35, 4).
Later the extravagant number of- 20, 40 and even 50 days was reached. “
The senatus consultum by which the supplicatio of 56 Β. C. was decreed
contained some novelties, specially honourable to Caesar, though what
these were cannot be exactly determined. Cf. Prov. Cons. 25 C. Caesari
supplicationes decrevistis, numero ut nemini uno ex bello ; honore, ut om·
nino nemini, ib. 27 dignitas verborum, honos, et novitas et numerus
(lterum Caesaris ipsizcs laudi gloriaeque concessus est,¹ Pis. 45 ut senatus
eos qui bene rem publicam gesserint, novis honoribus afficiat, et nutriero
dierum et genere verborum.

¹3 angustiis .· caused by the extraordinary expenditure on the corn-sup-
ply; cf. 40, 1. 7, Qu. Fr. 2, 5, 1.

14 decem legatos: the number of legati (adjutantS, staff-officers) allowed
as arule to each provincial governor was three3 but ten were appointed -
to serve under Caesar, nine of whom are mentioned by him in B. G. 7, 90.
See Fam. 1, 7, 10 et stipendium Caesari aecretum est, et decem legati, et
Sempronia lege ne succederetur, also Prov. Cons. 28.

15 lege Sempronia .· this law, passed by C. Gracchus, required the Senate
to designate the provinces which the consuls should govern, before the
consuls themselves were elected. The question was whether the pro-
vinces held by Caesar should be assigned for the consuls of 55 Β. c. 3 if
other provinces were assigned to these consuls, it became possible to
prolong Caesar’s command in Gaul, which was accordingly done in
5 5 Β. C. for five years.

16 1 princeps e! auctor: so Cic. boasts in Prow Cons. 26—28.

neque...putavi potius .· “ nor did I deem it more advisable”.

¹7 adsentiri desserzst‘onz'etc..· “to assent to the expression of an enmity
{once felt ’'‚ i. e. to speak in favour of those who in the Senate attacked
aesar. ·

18 convenire: “to adapt myself to the. crisis of my country”. N'agels-
bach wrongly makes temporibus, a's well as dissensioni. dependent on
adsentiri, and convenire directly dependent-on puttevi.—'-“ I thought it
fittinglthat* ete.” The phrase adsentiri temporibus is certainly inad-
missib e. . “ ‹ . ,
