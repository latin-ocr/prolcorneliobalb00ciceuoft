L. Cornelius Balbus came to Rome at the close of the wars.
and being ambitious and pushing, as well as a thorough man of
the world, he cultivated assiduously and to a great extent secured
the friendship of the leading Romans connected with all the
political parties. He increased his intimacy with Pompeius, from
whom he received rich presents, among them a lauded estate1.
Through the influence of Pompeius, Balbus was adopted by
Theophanes of Mitylene, a Greek historiari and intimate friend
of the general, by whom, like Balbus, he had been enfranchised2.
Theophanes had apparently been in Spain with Pompeius and
had contracted some alliance with the family of Balbus, When
this speech was delivered Theophanes had died, and his adopted
son had inherited from him a large property3.

In the year 70 there was a census, when Balbus was probably
enrolled as a citizen, but only in one of the tribus urbanae. As
the tribus rusticae ranked much higher in public esteem, Balbus
took care to secure admission to one of the most aristocratic, the
tribus Clustumina (or Crustumina). This he was enabled to do
by the provisions of the Roman criminal laW, which assigned
various rewards to those prosecutors who procured the convic-
tion of certain classes of offenders. These rewards seem to have
depended partly on the rank of the prosecutor, partly on that
of the criminal. Those who were not citizens already became
so, those who were citizens might attain a higher rank. Senators
might rise to a higher grade in the senate, while non-senators
might gain admission to a more important tribe, provided that
the offender were in that tribe. This was the case with Balbus,
though we know nothing of the criminal at whose expense he
obtained advancement4.

In the early years of his residence at Rome, Balbus became
closely allied with Caesar, who took him to Spain as praefectus
fabrum (chief of the engineers), when he went there himself to
govern Hispania ulterior as propraetor (61 B.C.). When Caesar
became proconsul of Gaul in 58, Balbus was again his praefictus
