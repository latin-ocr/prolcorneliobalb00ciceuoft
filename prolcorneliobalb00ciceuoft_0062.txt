9 ut eius gloriae, etc..· “that his renown is a household word to the
very limits of the national empire'’. It is impossible to represent
literally the metaphor in domicilium gloriae. In De Or. 1, 105 Rome is
called the domicilium imperi et gloriae, in Agr. 2, 97 Capua is the d.
superbiae. For imperi finibus terminetur cf. Arch. 2 3, and in Cat. 4, 21

Pompeius, cuius res gestae et virtutes eisdem quibus solis cursus regionibus
ac terminis continentur.

1 1 testes.- so Imp. Cn. P. 31 testes...omnes exterae gentes ac nationes.
Cn. Pompei...virtutis.· Cic. generally when he makes one gen. depend
on another, sostens the harshess of the construction by separatin the
genitives‚ as here; but eius, (as in eius ¹gloriae above ; cf. n. on 41, . υ)
liuius, illius are often allowed in juxtaposition with the other genitive.
In such passages as Brut. 163 Scaevolae dicendi elegantiam, Fin. 1, 14
Theophrasti orationis ornamenta, the-words following the proper name

cloalesceto sogm a single idea, and the harshness of the juxtaposition' is
t us m1t1gate .

12 mutae regiones: “voiceless tracts‚ and lands at the end of the world !'' ‚

14 sedcis: this implies an inhabitea' place, while the meaning of locus is
genera .

15 exstent: the subj. because the class is contemplated; “what spot of
such a kind that in it etc.'’ '

humanitatis: “culture ” (Arch. 2, l. 20, and 3, 1. 11) not commonly
found along with robustness (fhrtitua'o).

16 impressa vestigia: so metaphorically used in Or. 12 sermonum in
quibus Platonis sunt impressa vestigia.

18 neglexisse violasse rupisse: note the climart, which recalls the famous
abiit excessit evasit erupit.

has chosen the alternative most favourable to Pompeius, that knowingly
to do an illegal act betrays a more worthless character than to be totally
ignorant of what is legal''. Cic. then indicates that in his opinion Pom-
peius would be levior, more worthless or contemptible‚ had he done
wrong ignorantly‚ than if he had done it wittingly.

tanta re publica: “ such important public business ’⁹ (as Pompeius
had in Spain); the meaning cannot be here “such an important com-
monwealth’' (as Rome).
