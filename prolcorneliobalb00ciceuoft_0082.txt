24 clm-is...uostrae .· cf. Lucretius' patriai tempore iniquo.

26 nixa .· “ supported by '²3 note that nixus and nisus, both from nitor,
have somewhat different meanings3 nisus aliqua re=struggling, striving
by means of something, nixus aliqua re==relying on somethin . ’ ·

should be spoken of as fulmina imperi (to say nIdthing of the fact that the
genitive imperi is ill suited to the word fulmina). Lucretius 3, 1034‚and
his imitators Verg. Aen. 6, 842, Sil. 7, 106 might of course very well
call Scipio Africanus maior and minor fulmen or fulmina belli (not imperi).
Lumen is a very favourite word of Cic. and is very apt to get corrupted
in MSS (Marcell. 4 flumen ingeni is a corruption sor lumen). Cf. Α
with our passage Cat. 3, 24 lumina civitatis exstincta sunt, Prov.
Cons. 22 lumina atque ornamenta reipublicae (so Phil. 2, 37), Deiot. 15
omnium gentium atque omnis memoriae clarissimum lumen exstinguere,
Phil. 2, 51 tot luminibus exstinctis, Phil. 1 1, 24. It will be seen that the
word exstincti here is distinctly a 'point in favour of lumina. Observe
that it agrees with Scipiones, not lumina.

28 L. Marcius: commanded with considerable success the shattered
remnants of the Roman army after the defeat of the Scipios (Liv. 25, 373
26, 2). In 206 B.C. Gades surrendered to him (cf. Liv. 28, cc. 23, 30, 36,
37) at which time probably the treaty was concluded.

primi pigi centurio .· i. e. a centurion of the triarii, the third or
reserve line in the Roman order of battle. The hastati and principes
are often called antepilani. No probable philological account of the
phrase primi pili has yet been given. That of Corssen '(1, 529 sq.) is
farfetched and presumes the doubtful doctrine that only one centurio
among the triarii was called centurio primi pili.

31 teneretur: “ was upheld''. Religionis: the foedus had not been con-
cluded by the fetiales under public authority.

3² publici iuris .· “law relating to matters of state '' 3 opposed to pm'vati.
M. Lepido eta: i.e. in 78 Β. C.

33 postulaverunt: “made a request of the Senate''. The omission osan -

acc. is noteworthy.

P. 34.

2 sententiam non tulit: at the time (78 Β. C.) the matter was no doubt
treated, in accordance with Sulla’s principles, as one in which the
populus had no right to interfere.

3 nullo pacto .· here=null0 modo, as osten.
