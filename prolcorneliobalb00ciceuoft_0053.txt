as the great orator Crassus could; etenim carries on and enforces the
, statement, “in fact'’. ’

6 perorandi: an explanatory or defining genitive. For extremus locus
see Introd. p. 14, and cf. Sest. 3 hoc extremo dicendi loco. -

7 praetervecta sit: like other compounds of vehor, praetervehor is really
a deponent verb, with a pres. part. praetervehens used in an intransi-
tive sense (Liv. 22, 49, 6 equo praetervehens). Sit not est, because not
Pompeius' actual speech, but the class to which it belongs, is indicated:
“a speech ofhsueh a nature that it has, etc.'’

9 non modo: an ellipse of dicam or the like ; cf. 10, 1. 17.

mea...cuiusquam: observe that Cic. writes the possessive pronoun

alia causa. Actor in another sense is joined with auctor in Sest. 61 dux
auctor actor rerum illarum and strongly contrasted with it in De Or. 2,
