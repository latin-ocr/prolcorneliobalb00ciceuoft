liabilities of the deceased. among them the liability to pay out of the
property the legacies to those who were not heredes). The Voconian law
(about 169 B.C.) aimed partly at the same object as the Furian, partly at
preventing the accumulation of property in the hands of women ; it provided
(ι) that no woman should be lzeres under a will, (2) that no woman,
(3) that no man should receive more under a will than passed to the

heres or heredes. The law applied only to testators who had been entered
on the censors' lists as worth 100,000 asses or more.

16 contentio Heracliensium: ‘ ‘discussion among the people of Heraclia''‚

Heraclia was civitas aequissimo iure ac foedere (Arch. 6, 1. 2 3); its foedus, Α

concluded by Fabricius in the times of Pyrrhus, was almost unique (prope
singulare, below, 50, l. 2 5). This is all the information we possess con-
cerning this foedus. It was probably made in 278 B.C. (the second
consulship of Fabricius3 cf. 50, l. 25 C. Fabricio consule ictum), at a
time when Rome still had a hard struggle with the Bruttii, Lucani
and Italian Greeks, so that Heraclia could make good terms for
its submission. It is fair to conjecture that the uniqueness of the
treaty consisted partly in the omission of the clause contained in the
other treaties with Graeco-Italian states, by which they were bound to
furnish ships to the Roman government. As levies of troops were never
required from coast townS, the Heracliotes would be free from all service
in time of war, a freedom they would at once lose by becoming Roman·
citizens. The treaty with Neapolis was older, dating from 326 Β. C.
(Liv. 8, 26, 6) when the Campanian Greeks were able to give Rome
welcome aid against the Samnites. The N eapolitans valued the eon-
nexion so highly that they resisted the most alluring offers from Hannibal
(Liv. 23, 15). Why they were unwilling to adopt the Iulian law can
only be conjectured. Perhaps the subjection to the census, the land-
service with the legion, the exchange of old laws for the Roman law, ·
the abolition of local politics, were among the chief things they disliked.
[In 216 13.C. (Liv. 2 3, 20, 2) a number of Praenestines who had served in
the Roman army, refused the franchise3 it is also worth observing that
M. Fulvius Flaccus, who in 125 proposed a law for the enfranchising the
socii, also brought in a bill relating to those who should refuse the
civitas 3 see Val. Max, 9, 5, 1.] In Fam. ια, 3ο, 1, Cic. speaks osa man
